President Andy Stern and Secretary-Treasurer Anna Burger have visited the White House nearly 60 times, including 11 meetings with Obama and another with Vice President Biden.\nThe White House yesterday released more than 25,000 visitor records from Sept. 16-30. Included in the release were nearly 2,000 pre-Sept. 16 records based on specific requests. The records are publicly available on WhiteHouse.gov.\nSEIU\u2019s Stern and Burger visited the White House three times in September; a fourth meeting was canceled. Their 58 total visits (27 by Stern and 31 by Burger) dating to the start of the Obama administration far outpace their fellow union leaders. Earlier this month Americans for Tax Reform and the Alliance for Worker Freedom requested a lobbying investigation into the SEIU given its close ties to the White House.\nNext on the list is AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka with nine visits, followed by United Steelworkers President Leo Gerard, who has been to the White House eight times. Gerard scored an invite to see Obama greet the Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins on Sept. 10. United Steelworkers is headquartered in Pittsburgh.\nStern, Burger, Trumka and Gerard were the only four union leaders to have personal meetings with Obama. Burger, known as the \u201cQueen of Labor,\u201d serves on the President\u2019s Economic Recovery Advisory Board.\nThe records present a glimpse into who has access to Obama and his staff. While Stern\u2019s frequent visits come as no surprise \u2014 a previous release showed his close ties to the White House \u2014 the latest set of data offers more clues about who\u2019s in and who\u2019s not.\nTeamsters President James Hoffa, for instance, shows up only once on the list for a Sept. 29 for a meeting with Nate Tamarin, associate White House political director who serves as a liaison to labor unions.\nMost of the labor leaders whose names appear in the records were at the same meeting with Tamarin, who previously ran Obama\u2019s presidential campaign in Illinois. Others at the meeting included Burger, Stern, Trumka, American Rights at Work Chairman David Bonier, Communications Workers President Lawrence Cohen, UAW President Ron Gettelfinger, Electrical Workers President Edwin Hill, American Rights at Work Executive Director Mary Beth Maxwell, AFSCME President Gerald McEntee, Christyne Neff of United Food and Commercial Workers, National Education Association President Dennis Van Roekel, and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten.\nOne of the last meetings covered by the records took place on Sept. 29 with Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and three top officials from the AFL-CIO: Trumka, General Counsel Jonathan Hiatt and Government Affairs Director William Samuel.\nThe influence of labor leaders on the White House isn\u2019t all that surprising. Big Labor spent an estimated $450 million on the 2008 election, and the SEIU alone put $85 million into the political campaign \u2014 almost $30 million just for Obama\u2019s election.\nYet despite the frequency of visits, the pace of progress on Big Labor\u2019s priorities has disappointed union leaders. Politico reported earlier this month that many labor leaders are hoping 2010 produces better results, including passage of the misnamed Employee Free Choice Act, which would strip workers of their right to vote in private and give control of the workplace to government bureaucrats.\nUnion leaders expressed further frustration over the health care bill that emerged in the Senate. In order to raise money, Democrats plan to tax Cadillac health insurance packages that are common for unions. Several unions, including the AFL-CIO, Communications Workers of America and National Education Association, have criticized the legislation for what would amount to a 40 percent tax on those plans.", "author": "@Rob Bluey", "semantria_id": "4eb81905cb1311e282ab406c8f137d85", "semantria": {"status": "PROCESSED", "sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "config_id": "b12a1cc1-77fc-4466-8f62-94c366dc9fca", "language": "English", "phrases": [{"sentiment_polarity": "positive", "title": "top prize", "negating_phrase": "", "sentiment_score": 0.8455, "is_negated": false, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "positive", "title": "top officials", "negating_phrase": "", "sentiment_score": 0.8, "is_negated": false, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "positive", "title": "favorite", "negating_phrase": "", "sentiment_score": 0.6, "is_negated": false, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "negative", "title": "criticized", "negating_phrase": "", "sentiment_score": -0.6, "is_negated": false, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "negative", "title": "frustration", "negating_phrase": "", "sentiment_score": -0.5733, "is_negated": false, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "specific requests"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "fourth meeting"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "total visits"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "fellow union"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "close ties"}], "topics": [{"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "title": "Labor", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "hitcount": 0, "type": "concept", "strength_score": 0.7782477}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "title": "Health", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "hitcount": 0, "type": "concept", "strength_score": 0.56857944}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "title": "Elections", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "hitcount": 0, "type": "concept", "strength_score": 0.5505705}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "title": "Business", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "hitcount": 0, "type": "concept", "strength_score": 0.515052}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "title": "Politics", "sentiment_score": 0.118781, "hitcount": 3, "type": "query", "strength_score": 0.0}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "title": "Health", "sentiment_score": 0.37669998, "hitcount": 2, "type": "query", "strength_score": 0.0}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "title": "Education", "sentiment_score": 0.15378, "hitcount": 1, "type": "query", "strength_score": 0.0}], "summary": "President Andy Stern and Secretary-Treasurer Anna Burger have visited the White House nearly 60 times, including 11 meetings with Obama and another with Vice President Biden...

However, liberal blogs Huffington Post and FireDogLake are reporting that the President is frustrated with a lack of progress on his nominations and may be renominating Becker again.\nAccording to FireDogLake:\nNow, in all likelihood, McCain will again slap a hold on Becker; the White House will then have a couple options. It can negotiate with McCain for something else he wants; the HELP committee can hold a full hearing on Becker like McCain wants; Harry Reid can force a vote and get 60 senators to vote for Becker, which will end up being a proxy fight over the Employee Free Choice Act; or McCain\u2019s icy heart will melt and allow Becker to go through.\nIn either case, as Becker\u2019s nomination goes, so do the other 2 NLRB nominees, who must be voted on in a package with Becker. Meanwhile, the 2-member NLRB will continue to make uncontroversial rulings on pending cases that may yet be ruled invalid by the Supreme Court.\nRead more from HuffPo here\nThe EFCA Echo Chamber:\nYou may have noticed lately that there\u2019s a lot of chatter throughout the blogosphere about the likelihood of Democrats attempting to muscle the job-destroying and hallucinogenically-named Employee Free FORCED Choice Act.\nAlthough much of the chatter surrounding EFCA\u2019s timing is purely conjecture at this point, the chances are the chatter is correct.\nUnion bosses know that their days to get anything like EFCA done in DC are numbered. In fact, there are only ten months and three weeks left before Americans head to polls to either rebuke and repudiate the leftward lean of Washington or give the Democrats an endorsement of their running the country further into the ground. And, so far, it looks like the Democrats will be losing their 60-seat supermajority in the Senate as top Democrats run for the exits.\nThere\u2019s still hope (albeit slim) that a busy legislative schedule may impede EFCA.\nThe 2010 legislative calendar is still unclear with the nationalization of America\u2019s health care going into secret negotiations between House and Senate Democrats despite President Obama\u2019s repeated promises of airing the negotiations on C-SPAN. However, while the health care debate still goes on, it\u2019s being reported that the President is also preparing a push for amnesty for illegals, aka Immigration Reform. That debate will surely warm up the capital like a donkey\u2019s a** after eating hot plate of frijoles! [Editor's note: If you thought you were subscribing to a PC post, we apologize for any misgivings.]\nThis begs the question: What comes first? EFCA?\u2026Or making sure that 12 million illegal immigrants can become health-insured Democrat voters before November?\nLUR\u2019s Labor Shorts: Exposing Union Bosses One Skid Mark at a Time\nFor previous Labor Shorts, go here.\nFugheddaboutit!

The White House knew media coverage would be minimal on the weekend, but Becker can\u2019t escape the scrutiny. (Heritage\u2019s Ryan O\u2019Donnell wrote about the controversial pick last week.)\nPrior to his appointment, Becker served as associate general counsel to the Service Employees International Union. The union, which spent an estimated $66 million in 2008 for Obama\u2019s election, has been rewarded dearly for its support. Becker is the third SEIU leader tapped for a post by Obama.\nSEIU President Andy Stern and Secretary-Treasurer Anna Burger are among the most frequent visitors to the White House. Public records released by the Obama Administration show that Stern made 38 trips to the White House and Burger made 43 visits through Dec. 31, 2009. This prompted Americans for Tax Reform and the Alliance for Worker Freedom to request a lobbying investigation into the SEIU given its close ties to the White House. (Stern is not a registered lobbyist.)\nThe appearance of preferential treatment hasn\u2019t stopped Obama from rewarding his allies at SEIU. Stern was picked in February to serve on Obama\u2019s debt commission. Burger was tapped for Obama\u2019s Economic Recovery Advisory Board in 2009. And now Becker, despite Senate opposition, has secured a coveted appointment to represent the Big Labor\u2019s interests at the NLRB.\nLike this:\nLike Loading...", "title": "Take Note of the Inimical\u00a0Strategy", "semantria_id": "503332facb1311e2968a406c8f137d85", "semantria": {"status": "PROCESSED", "sentiment_polarity": "positive", "config_id": "b12a1cc1-77fc-4466-8f62-94c366dc9fca", "language": "English", "phrases": [{"sentiment_polarity": "positive", "title": "public records", "negating_phrase": "", "sentiment_score": 0.679149, "is_negated": false, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "positive", "title": "rewarded", "negating_phrase": "", "sentiment_score": 0.66, "is_negated": false, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "positive", "title": "general counsel", "negating_phrase": "", "sentiment_score": 0.601497, "is_negated": false, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "positive", "title": "rewarding", "negating_phrase": "", "sentiment_score": 0.6, "is_negated": false, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "positive", "title": "enjoying", "negating_phrase": "", "sentiment_score": 0.49, "is_negated": false, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "bipartisan rejectionof"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "n\u2019t escape"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "controversial pick"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "frequent visitors"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "close ties"}], "topics": [{"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "title": "Labor", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "hitcount": 0, "type": "concept", "strength_score": 0.7038502}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "title": "Elections", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "hitcount": 0, "type": "concept", "strength_score": 0.5722899}, {"sentiment_polarity": "positive", "title": "Politics", "sentiment_score": 0.8494655, "hitcount": 1, "type": "query", "strength_score": 0.0}], "summary": "Posted March 29th, 2010 at 12:30pm by Rob Bluey While most Americans were enjoying a weekend away from work, President Obama kept busy Saturday afternoon, appointing one of Big Labor\u2019s lawyers to a post at the National Labor Relations Board...

Prior to his work with Obama, Gaspard was the lead political operative for the 1199 branch of the Service Employees International Union, a huge and hugely influential union representing health care workers in New York. He spent the 2004 general election as the national field director for America Coming Together.\nRecently, there\u2019s been some light shed on the SEIU\u2019s mole inside the White House that, not surprisingly, the mainstream media (MSM) has not picked up on.\nSeveral weeks ago, Big Government blogger Kyle Olsen exposed the fact that, in 2009, the SEIU 1199 paid Gaspard $37,191. That\u2019s on top of the $74,552 that SEIU 1199 paid Gaspard in 2008.\nNow, the unanswered question remains\u2026unanswered: Why did the SEIU pay nearly $40,000 to the White House Political Director?\nKeeping in mind that Gaspard spend much of 2008 on the Obama campaign, as well as from November 2008 through January 2009 working on Obama\u2019s transition, the SEIU can\u2019t really claim Gaspard was doing any SEIU work in 2009\u2026or was he?\nIs there any correlation with this?\nThis past Saturday, Politico\u2019s Ben Smith broke an intriguing story about SEIU\u2019s Andy Stern and Anna Burger having \u201cadvanced\u201d talk\u201d with Gaspard about taking over the SEIU as the number two person, to replace Anna Burger when she assumed Andy Stern\u2019s role upon his retirement.\nThe talks grew quite advanced: Stern and Burger spoke with George Gresham, the pivotal president of the union\u2019s largest local, New York\u2019s 1199, and offered him assurances not just that Gaspard would be given the number-two job, but that he would eventually succeed Burger as president, the sources said. Gresham indicated that he would throw his weight behind the slate.\n  Gaspard, who left the post of 1199 political director to take the same job on the Obama campaign, could well have pulled a united union behind Burger. Between the support of 1199 and the catch of a former senior White House official, it\u2019s unclear that a rival campaign would have developed.\n  \u201cThey started working on him in late January/early February to join her as Secretary Treasurer while Anna filled out the remainder of Andy\u2019s term,\u201d one of the sources said. \u201cTheir calculus was that he would never turn down the dream job \u2014 President of SEIU \u2014 and that this would lock in the votes for her because Gresham and [executive board member Gerald] Hudson would give her their votes since they are tight with Gaspard.\u201d\n  Another source said that while there was never an explicit promise of when Burger would hand over the reins to Gaspard, the promise of the presidency at some point was explicit.\nAlthough the early leak of Stern\u2019s resignation from the SEIU supposedly squelched the triumvirate talks over who would run the SEIU, it was the internal mutiny against Burger taking over the SEIU helm that completely fried any chances that the plot plan to put Gaspard into the number two seat would come to fruition.\nAccording to Smith\u2019s sources, Gaspard turned the offer down out of \u201cloyalty\u201d to the President. However, that too is questionable, since it appears there was already an underground campaign to keep Burger from taking Stern\u2019s position once he left.\nOf course, it remains arguable whether the Obama administration\u2019s rules prohibiting aides from becoming lobbyists would restrict Gaspard from going back to the SEIU, especially since the rules against lobbying seem so unclear in the SEIU\u2019s case.\nBut, of course, you can learn all about this in the media\u2026[When the media starts doing its job.]\n In the meantime, regardless of whether Mary Kay Henry or Anna Burger is running the purple behemoth, the SEIU still has its mole man inside the White House, doing its bidding and keeping an eye on the union\u2019s investment, and it looks like that\u2019s not going to change any time soon.\n __________________\n \u201cI bring reason to your ears, and, in language as plain as ABC, hold up truth to your eyes.\u201d Thomas Paine, December 23, 1776\nFor more news and views on today\u2019s unions, go to LaborUnionReport.com.\nCross-posted.", "author": "Loren Heal", "semantria_id": "507f7959cb1311e2b8b5406c8f137d85", "semantria": {"status": "PROCESSED", "sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "config_id": "b12a1cc1-77fc-4466-8f62-94c366dc9fca", "language": "English", "phrases": [{"sentiment_polarity": "positive", "title": "succeed", "negating_phrase": "", "sentiment_score": 0.72, "is_negated": false, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "positive", "title": "mutiny", "negating_phrase": "against", "sentiment_score": 0.60007, "is_negated": true, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "negative", "title": "resignation", "negating_phrase": "", "sentiment_score": -0.6, "is_negated": false, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "negative", "title": "prohibiting", "negating_phrase": "", "sentiment_score": -0.6, "is_negated": false, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "negative", "title": "restrict", "negating_phrase": "", "sentiment_score": -0.6, "is_negated": false, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "secretly work"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "outside union"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "been spent"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "presidential task"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "been paid"}], "topics": [{"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "title": "Elections", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "hitcount": 0, "type": "concept", "strength_score": 0.5858988}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "title": "Labor", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "hitcount": 0, "type": "concept", "strength_score": 0.5668202}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "title": "Health", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "hitcount": 0, "type": "concept", "strength_score": 0.5164416}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "title": "Business", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "hitcount": 0, "type": "concept", "strength_score": 0.4958254}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "title": "Politics", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "hitcount": 0, "type": "concept", "strength_score": 0.4917453}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "title": "Politics", "sentiment_score": 0.40862405, "hitcount": 2, "type": "query", "strength_score": 0.0}, {"sentiment_polarity": "positive", "title": "Health", "sentiment_score": 1.1714318, "hitcount": 1, "type": "query", "strength_score": 0.0}], "summary": "Do you know what a union mole is?...
