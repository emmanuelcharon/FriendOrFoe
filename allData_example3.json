      "text": "Over the past few years, I\u2019ve been invited to come speak at various events. No big surprise there, as I\u2019ve probably met a bunch of you at them. Since there\u2019s a chance that some are publicly speaking for the first time in Austin this year, I figured I\u2019d share a few things I\u2019ve tried along the way.\nThese tips will probably be more relevant if you\u2019re a nervous talker and you suspect you won\u2019t fill in enough time. (If you\u2019re a rambler, there are other people who can offer you far better advice than I.) It\u2019s timely in a way, because I think I\u2019ve finally crossed a threshold in my own speaking. I started off early 2004 in a bit of a fluster, went into overdrive preparation mode during most of 2005, and now in 2006, I think I\u2019m easing into speaking naturally and comfortably. Finally.\nWhen I first started, I wasn\u2019t sure how to plan for time constraints. Speaking for an hour seemed like a long time to keep going, and there was always a good chance I\u2019d miss important points along the way and end really early.\nSo I approached my preparation as if I were writing an article, which would take approximately an hour to read out loud. I\u2019d hole up in a cafe and breeze through a logical progression of thoughts that ended up being 10 pages or more of printed text, and try to separate that out into smaller bite-sized points for easier scanning when presenting. Then I\u2019d build slides based on that. It was a lot of work.\nNot only was I concerned about the time constraints though, I also got spooked out of allowing myself to ramble at all. I\u2019ve talked through three slides past the one that\u2019s currently on screen, only to madly catch up later. I\u2019ve realized halfway through that I didn\u2019t make a bunch of important points earlier to help support the current slide, so it in turn makes no sense without that context. I\u2019ve even gotten completely stuck from time to time, I think the most notable was on stage at WE04. \u201cUh, I completely forgot where I was going with that\u2026\u201d So to help myself avoid any repeats, I\u2019ve been meticulous in my preparation and made sure to have the entire presentation outlined, with a paper backup on hand, to ensure I could talk my way out of any glitches.\nBut that spiraled out of control, since every time I presented I tried to deliver new material, adapted to the theme of the conference. And thus, new supporting material. Not such a hot idea, I found out, as it\u2019s probably more important to be familiar with your material and comfortable when delivering it, than to be fresh all the time. Not to mention the extra time and effort creating a new set of slides every single time.\nSo recently, I\u2019ve realized a few things that I think are making me a better speaker. I\u2019ve stopped spending ages coming up with finely-detailed outlines of each presentation, and instead I\u2019m leaving more to real-time interaction. I\u2019m still no Veen or Molly, and likely will never be, but at least I\u2019m comfortable in my own methods now, and I think that\u2019s the real key to presenting well.\nKnow your material. But plan to make mistakes anyway. If you talk through a bunch of slides, oh well. Make them available later, and it\u2019s no big deal. If you have to back up and provide extra context that you missed earlier, go right ahead. You can even tell people that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing, although you probably don\u2019t need to. Also, if you\u2019re more of a bullet-point presenter, you can even use your slides as notes to keep you focused throughout. That\u2019s hardly a bad system, though we all know why PowerPoint is evil\u2026\nNervousness goes away. Five minutes into it, you\u2019ll stop being nervous and start having a bit more fun. And after doing a few presentations, you\u2019ll stop getting those butterflies in your stomach before hand, and feel a lot more at home on a stage.\nPause. Get used to taking small pauses here and there, to take a sip of water, to collect your thoughts, to slow yourself down, or whatever else. It\u2019s okay to have a few seconds of silence.\nHave a water bottle with you on stage. You\u2019ll need it for the dry mouth. Some lip balm might not be a bad idea either, if you\u2019re talking more than once.\nIf you get stuck on-stage, it\u2019s not a bad thing. You simply move on to the next topic. The audience might notice, or they might not. A lot of the things you\u2019re thinking internally during that moment will never get picked up by anyone else, so if what you\u2019re saying still makes some form of sense, chances are no one will catch it. (And if it doesn\u2019t make sense, often that\u2019s just glossed over! Not everyone is 100% coherent all the time when speaking, and it rarely matters.)\nBe prepared to allow for spontaneity. You can\u2019t really plan for the asides and diversions that you might make while on stage, but allow them to happen when they do. Often you\u2019ll explore a related idea that ties in with your main points nicely, and it\u2019ll work its way into future presentations. Try to keep yourself always coming back to the topic at hand, or at the very least, make sure to highlight why your diversion is relevant to the discussion. Don\u2019t spend too long on them, however.\nHave a lot of slides. If you\u2019re worried about time, just make sure you\u2019ve got more material than you need. Chances are you won\u2019t get through it all, but that\u2019s not a terrible problem to have. I\u2019d say 40 to 50 slides is probably enough to fill up an entire hour, as that\u2019s just over a minute each. As you get more comfortable, you can start bringing that number down.\nBe prepared, but it\u2019s not worth killing yourself. Don\u2019t go for broke on the slides, go for broke on familiarizing yourself with your topic and your slides. Do three dry runs before you get up on stage. Time yourself, and don\u2019t try to back up and re-try anything during the dry runs. Learn how to talk your way out of a factual error you just caught, speaking flub, or even just simple mispronunciation. Pretend there\u2019s an audience right in front of you and you only have that hour. This will quickly highlight the problem points, and often it\u2019ll cause you to re-arrange your slides.\nIf you don\u2019t fill the entire hour, no big deal. (If you\u2019re only hitting the 30 minute mark, you might need to have more material next time.) Q&A can usually fill up the rest of your time slot, and ever since I\u2019ve started speaking I\u2019ve had more fun answering questions than talking during the actual presentation. Try to make your talk amenable to follow-up questions, and if you\u2019ve got a small enough room (anything over 50 people is pushing it) you can even encourage questions throughout.\nMake sure you\u2019ve got a strong start, and the rest will fall into place. The first few minutes are the most important. The audience doesn\u2019t know what you\u2019re like, you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re like, so you need to get people interested. Plus, the sea of quiet faces is a bit overwhelming, so if you need to script any part of your presentation, this is the best part to script. After you\u2019ve gone through the introduction and started getting into the meat of it, people are likely to be more receptive and you won\u2019t feel so on the spot.\nRe-use material. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with this. If you\u2019re giving repeat presentations, feel free to dip into past talks and pull out points. I lean towards illustrated slides instead of bullet points these days, so I\u2019ve even built up an illustration library which I\u2019ll happily re-use for new talks, even if the subject matter changes.\nOf course SXSW is more oriented toward 15 or 20 minutes of talking, so the time frame is a bit different. But chances are sooner or later you\u2019ll need to talk for an hour or so. Hopefully you\u2019ll be a natural, but if not, maybe these tips will help.",

      "text": "Menu\nWe are all Modern Magellans making our way in the world. I believe everyone has a very important business - life. Your life and everything you are responsible for is your business. Many people believe that they cannot run a business but I know two things -\n(1) You can. (2) You will have to.\nI recently finished writing my first book, Maps for Modern Magellans. It's about leadership, entrepreneurship, and business transformation. Other ideas or concepts would occur to me as I was writing. Many of these concepts do not require a whole chapter to explain them. So, I will share a few of them here in a brief 5 point format. Every day or so I will add one and once this gets too long I will move one off to the archives on the book site www.mapsformodernmagellans.com\nI will also be changing the video now and again so you may want to subscribe to the RSS feed to be made aware of changes. You are welcome to visit often but you should be too busy to just drop by.\nThis lens is getting quite long but I continue to receive compliments on all of the sections so I hesitate to move anything off. I will begin adding new material just after the video so that it is easier to find. You can also use the index to the left for the first 5 items.\n1\n Spend too much on SEO, and not enough on content\n2\n Become obsessed with blogging\n3\n Too personal\n4\n Trolls\n5\n Start, then abandon after just a little while\n6\n Do it badly (Spelling, Links, Categories, Layout)\n7\n Reveal too much\n8\n Fight online with customers\n9\n Lie\n10\n Whine\n You can read the fully annotated version on the  Modern Magellans blog. Complete with links and comments.\n1\n It can be a daily Press Release\n2\n You can demonstrate expertise\n3\n Make your own Engadget like site\n4\n Improve the dialog with your core customers\n5\n Share appropriate information - FREE ADVERTISING!\n6\n Hold contests to win products\n7\n Trial balloon ideas\n8\n Let your customers design things\n9\n Run Polls\n10\n Find new revenue streams\n You can read the fully annotated version on the  Modern Magellans blog. Complete with links and comments.\n1  You are a business Your career, what you do, and why you get paid are your business.\n 2   Your competition is The people who have the job or position you want, the people who are competing for your position, and the owner of your competing business is.\n 3   It takes time You cannot rush this. It is more than polishing a resume. You need to build some brand equity. You do that with every action, word, or promise. It is easy to forget but hard to fix if it goes untended for too long.\n 4   Not everyone is Fortunately, few people do it right, if they do it at all. This is where you can have an advantage. It does not even require that you put in extra hours. You just have to take a little more thought about your actions.\n 5   You are doing it anyway What you do. How you do it says something about you. Each action, every word, and how you behave creates an impression in those around you. That is your brand. You can control it or let it go untended.\n A great source of information on this is Krishna De\n I also posted an article on this topic.\nFor the full text and explanation go to The Reasoner. Be sure to add any comments you might have.\n 1. Be honest\n 2. Do what you say\n 3. Focus on both your and other's well being\n 4. Be respectful\n 5. Do not get too personal\n I would add:\n 6. Watch your Language\n 7. Manner of Dress - sloppy is not casual\n 8. Give a day's work for a day's pay\n 9. No gossip\n 10. Build don't destroy - people, places, and things.\nOften people feel compelled to share insight into their life that is not appropriate.\n Such as:\n1. Grooming habits\n 2. Diseases you have had\n 3. Cute baby bodily function stories\n 4. How much you over-indulge\n 5. What you keep in your freezer\n You will find a more detailed explanation on the Modern Magellans blog.\n Should you feel inclined to share similar information - save it for your MySpace page, YouTube video, or blog...\n I have received some other input on this topic and I'll list it here for your benefit.\nRefrain from telling and re-telling pointless stories about your children. - Amen to that!\nStep 1 - Have a Compelling Vision\n Step 2 - Create Urgency, Use Leverage\n Step 3 - Establish A Change Team\n Step 4 - Get Message out - Act Accordingly\n Step 6 - Create & Celebrate Milestones\n Step 7 - Reinforce, and Recommit to Goals;\n Step 8 - Lock-in Change, Fight Regression\n I swapped 1 and 3 because I believe few small companies have enough people to form a change team to discover a vision. The leader has to have the vision and then get everyone to see it.\n A larger version of the diagram is available here.\nSince iFrams are no longer allowed on Squidoo - you will need to go to ScribD to see the chapter as a PDF that you do not need to download to read!\n Introduction\n#1) Perception is reality - It is not what you say, it is what others think you said that matters.\n #2) Focus is not narrow-mindedness - Some unimportant things become VERY important if they are ignored for too long. Family, taxes, and common courtesy to name a few.\n #3) Just because you can, does not mean you should - The singing fish, the AMC Pacer, and Warren Buffet running for President.\n #4) A map must be usable to be useful - Clarity is not automatic. Just because your \"map\" makes sense to you does not mean it will make sense to anyone else. (See points on Presentation below).\n #5) Charge more than it costs - The sum total of the effort should be worth the investment.\n If each one is not immediately clear to you that is not a big problem. It will only be a big problem if each is never clear to you.\nThe best - well there are several but the one that stands out the most called on my lab when I was I was a grad student at CalTech. He never interrupted a discussion or an experiment. He kept track of what we worked on an seemed know what items we used most frequently. He left a business card each time if you were not there. Just a hello, I was here. Sorry I missed you. No pressure at all. If we needed something he made sure we got it ASAP.\n The worst - No names to protect the guilty. I was in the middle of an experiment that required a lot of concentration. For 40 minutes I had to have my hands above my head repeatedly for this task. It was tiring and the sooner you finished the better. Just after I had started this individual enters the lab and begins to talk to me about how he can get me a better deal on the materials I use. I am a very meticulous shopper so I doubted he could. In fact I knew he couldn't. I told him I was busy but he just sat on the desk by my workbench and started to tell me how much he hated his job. This was in 1992 and he was thinking about going into shrimp boating. After that all I could think of was Forrest Gump. \"Forrest\" did not leave until I finished and was able to concentrate on explaining how he would never ever sell anything to anyone I knew again.\n The lesson - be there when you are needed and don't be there when you are not.\n1  Easy to carry on - Swords, Large hats or stuffed animals might seem cute in the store but they can be expensive to transport home.\n 2   Show thought - Don't buy it in the airport gift shop. Somehow they always find out.\n 3   Easy to tell where it comes from - Has country, state or city name on it. It can also be something very characteristic of the place.\n 4   Not embarrassing to recieve - Naked hula dancers are out. T-shirts with corny slogans will never be worn. The more you like it, the less your kids probably will.\n 5   Something they will treasure - A smile on your face that says you are happy to see them!\n It helps if you can find a theme to go with. I have two sons so I brought back little baseball bats from the games I would attend. My wife liked thimbles and they are very easy to transport but it was hard to find touristy ones in Japan.\nThere are more and that you will find on another Squidoo Lens - The Business Alphabet\n  T) - Team, Timing, Totally (Committed)\n  M) - Money, Market, Moxie\n  P) - Product, People, Position, Property (Intellectual)\n  L) - Leadership, Love, Luck\n  E) - Enthusiasm, Energy, Eloquence\n Please visit the The Business Alphabet and add you words and definitions. I'll move the best ones for each letter hear as they are voted on.\n Do it! Why spend money and go to meetings if you come home with nothing but notes?\n The more you give the more you get. Be helpful and not one-sided. What goes around comes around. If you get a reputation for being helpful people will seek you out.\n 5 minutes. Be effective, polite, move on. After 5 minutes you may be boring them anyway.\n Business cards are for sharing and for note taking. (See Gaping Void or better yet click the link near the top of the right hand column.\n Learn to say excuse me in multiple languages - it helps start and end conversations.\n Say your hook first - you do not know how much time you will have. Their floor could come soon, they could get a call. You could be uninterrupted at any second.\n Don't Pounce - if you are lucky they will only be suspicious of you and what it is you want. (Most likely they will wonder what you were on if you blow the pitch.)\n If you are lucky the power will go out - This will allow for a lot of conversation time. Don't just talk about yourself. Try to ask a few questions about them.\n If you are unlucky the power will go out - Who wants to hear about your business when they are stuck in an elevator unless it has to do with preventing further episodes like this.\n Practice - When the moment comes there will be no second chance to do it over again. Ask any veteran and they will tell you how many times they blew a fabulous chance by getting flustered.\n  more on this can be found here.\n1) Something to say Anyone can talk but few people can present well. The best speakers do not need slides or music to be successful.\n2) Demonstration or promotional video Preferably a recent video that includes a positive audience response.\n3) Referral List People who have heard you speak that can recommend you.\n4) Collateral materials A book, white-papers, audio or video file samples.\n5) A press Kit Program description, topic, biography and a photo.\n1  Use Flash or PowerPoint slides on timers\n -- You don't worry about hitting the wrong key, you don't add off-track comments, you don't have to ask for \"Next slide please.\" If you tell people the presentation is on a timer they hold questions until the end, and you finish on time every time! (Even Vcs!)\n2  Be Early\n -- Make sure things work and you know who can help if they do not. Bring a thumb drive, a CD, and hard copy if you can - just in case.\n3  Be Focused and Be the Focus\n -- If the power went out did you make your point? Can you be as good without the slide show? Slides should add to what you say and not be the show.\n4  Use One Transition\n -- If you must use a transition make sure it is not a distraction. Use only one of the following: Slide from left, fadeout, slide from right. Anything else is distracting and you want the audience to hear you.\n5  Don't Distract\n -- Let go of the podium, don't tap the mike as you talk, and be normal. The audience should be listening to what you say not thinking about what may be wrong with you.\n Slides should add not be your presentation. If they are, maybe you can just add a soundtrack and sit down. You are the presenter, and you should be the one of the most important things they remember.\n  Seth Godin's Riff on ppt\n Guy Kawasaki's 10/20/30\n PresentationZen has some useful comments as well.\n See my experience May 31,2007 to see why you need to over prepare.\n1) The \"One Thing\" Arnold Beckman said is the most important thing a company can do that Marcus Buckingham did not include in his book \"The One Thing You Should Know\" and why it may be more important than anything else you do.\n 2) A column missing from the table on page 126 of the \"Art of the Start\" by Guy Kawasaki that makes the table more useful.\n 3) The 3 very important steps beyond Everett Rogers' 5 \"Diffusion of Innovation\" steps. Everett Rogers is considered the originator of the famous adoption curve.\n 4) How to launch a cow (Purple or not), product, brand or company so that it travels the greatest distance, stays in the air longer or has the optimal flight path.\n 5) A Mr. Boffo cartoon by Joe Martin that helps you see why you may need to change your focus.\n You can order \"Maps for Modern Magellans: Charts for Captains of Commerce\" by visiting the  book website, or buy it now at 800-CEO-READ.

How many are doing what you do?\n2) There are 5.5 million registered businesses with 1 or more employees Just in case you thought you were alone in your business challenges.\n3) 25% of the founders of the businesses with employees had not taken ANY college classes before they started their present business. Some never went to college.\n4) Of the businesses with employees only 20% of the founders or owners had advanced degrees (MBA, PhD, EhD, JD and so on) when they started their current business.

      "text": "Computer slide presentations are one of the ways we sell in person. We create the slides, show them to a prospect and then leave them on our machines for the next time we need them.\nWhy let them go to waste? By hosting them online, we can repurpose them as marketing and soft sales pieces.\nAside from repurposing existing presentations by loading them online, what if you want to create new presentations from scratch that do more \u2014 that contain a mix of slides, browser screen shots, product images, and even short video clips? Today you can easily do that and often for free. Jing and some of the tools below make it possible to create a more dynamic presentation, complete with audio, animation, and video that you can position on the Web for customers to review at their convenience.\nSo here are 11 presentation tools for creating outstanding presentations or just repurposing already-existing presentations, for your sales and marketing. NOTE: There is a follow-on post with 33 Highly Useful Presentation Tools linked at the end of this post.\n1. Slideshare is a well known presentation hosting site. It has great web applications to let you distribute your presentations to LinkedIn, Facebook, and many other social networks. It is becoming its own social network, in essence. They do not let you build a presentation as many of these others do; you only can host it there. It is simply a presentation portal where your ideas and thoughts can garner traffic and links.\n2. Google Presentations - It sometimes feels to me that Google does everything that I need online. It isn\u2019t true, of course, but Google Docs does offer Google Presentations. You can create a presentation from scratch or upload a Powerpoint file to Google and then share it with others. A basic tour is found here.\n3. Zoho Show does a lot more than presentation hosting. Zoho\u2019s tool in this category is excellent and collaborative. If you need to have a chat going while you\u2019re presenting, this is one to look at.\n4. Prezi is one of the hottest startups in the presentation world. Takes a new look at presentations, gives you a large canvas to place images, videos, text and then lets you zoom in and out on various parts of your \u201cpresentation.\u201d You have to host your presentation at Prezi, but you can embed it into your site or blog once you\u2019ve done that. Their technology appears to be too robust to package up in any current file format. I liked this phrase from their site: \u201cPrezi is zooming sketches on a digital napkin.\u201d\n5. authorStream allows you to convert your Powerpoint into video, which then lets you tap into all of the other video type hosting services like Vimeo, YouTube, Viddler, and others. This YouTube Marketing post by Travis Campbell inspired me to investigate the different options you are reading now. I wondered if I could put my presentations on high traffic video sites without having to do a video.\n6. Jing is a screen capture program that lets you capture whatever you have on your desktop (slides, webpage, image) and add audio as you click through. You can then save it to their slide presentation hosting site, Screencast or download it for email, chat or the web.\nIn the past I have frequently used GoToMeeting.com. The only problem? I was unable to save some of the audio from my presentations. So I used Jing to re-create my presentation, added browser screens in a tour-like fashion, and audio. I was then able to email it to the people who could not join the presentation. The feedback was always terrific.\n7. KinetiCast is a presentation hosting service that\u2019s great for the analytical types who just have to know what happens when a prospect views the presentation. You upload your presentation, then send your prospect a download link which KinetiCast then tracks if the prospect actually visits and what they look at as well as how long they spend. They also let you download your presentation as a video.\n8. Empressr has been widely written about and it is one of the market leaders. You can create your presentation, add video, audio, photos, then host it there for free and share it with others. They call it the world\u2019s first free online storytelling tool.\n9. 280Slides is a browser-based tool that requires no download. If you do not have presentation software, this is one of the most intuitive tools I\u2019ve seen for free. You simply work right from your browser to create slides, insert video, photos, and audio and save in different formats. It also lets you publish it direct to Slideshare, which I found pretty neat.\n10. Myplick lets you upload your presentation and then add audio to it. It is a slide hosting service, smaller and less well known than Slideshare, but because it helps you place audio into the presentation, I include it here. They give you various options for including your audio into a presentation allowing you to upload a video with the sound you want.\n11. vcasmo allows you to put video and presentations together, which is pretty interesting. Your video goes on the left side and slides on the right. As you talk through your presentation, you are demonstrating your service or product by video. It looks and feels like an in-person presentation with their format.\n* * * * *\nThese tools can help you create presentations from scratch or enliven existing presentations with audio and screenshots. If you\u2019ve ever given a presentation via PowerPoint or some other software tool, you can give that work a new life and post your presentations online. Or just create a new whiz-bang presentation with all the bells and whistles.\nGive some of these a try and let us know which ones work for you. Tell us about others you may like.\nIf you need just a few more, click over to our 33 Highly Useful Presentation Tools followup post.",

      "text": "The smartest financial guy in the world, Warren Buffett, has a saying that goes something like this: you should be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful. What Warren means is that if everyone is jumping on the bandwagon you should hesitate because in most cases when something looks too good to be true, it usually is. And when people aren\u2019t jumping on the bandwagon you should take a closer look at it because the reward of doing so could be extremely high.\nRight now everyone seems to be fearful, so I would like to share with you a few ways I am trying to be greedy (which will hopefully make me rich).\nStock Market\nDuring the last few months the stock market took a big dip. Just about every stock is down which has caused people to become fearful about playing in the stock market. I don\u2019t know if the stock market is at its lowest and truthfully I don\u2019t really care. I just know that within the next 5 years it should be doing better than it is now and because of this I am being greedy when it comes to playing the stock market.\nCompared to most people I have very little knowledge about the stock market. But one thing I do know is that companies that the government has bailed out are very unlikely to go bankrupt\u2026 especially ones like AIG who received 150 billion dollars. Due to this I have been buying stocks like AIG because I feel I will make a substantial return on my investment within the next 5 years.\nBuying Companies\nA lot of business owners are in debt right now, and as you know, cash is king during a recession. So when a business owner is looking to get rid of his profitable business because he is personally in debt, you can squeeze him to get a very favorable deal for yourself.\nWhat I have been doing in the last few months is hitting up popular websites and asking them if they are interested in selling. In most cases website owners aren\u2019t selling, but every once in a while you will find a website owner who is willing to sell at a great price because he is personally strapped for money due to some rare circumstances.\nAngel Investing\nVenture capitalists and angel investors aren\u2019t investing much money right now. Good companies who are in need of money are offering more equity in their company than they usually do. Because of this you could potentially get better returns from investing during this recession than most people have seen for decades.\nThese are the main 3 ways I am currently being greedy. Anyone else want to share how they are being greedy?\nDisclaimer: I am not an investment professional, this is just my opinion. Invest your money at your own risk.",

      "text": "Many presenters, particularly novices, struggle to find a presentation style that works best for them. Luckily, throughout the years, after much trial and error, many successful techniques and methodologies for presentation creation and delivery have emerged, giving speakers a variety of existing approaches to \u201cborrow\u201d from.\nFrom top left: Lawrence Lessig, Masayoshi Takahashi, Seth Godin, Mino Monta\nHere, we\u2019ll describe and evaluate some of the most famous \u2013 and popular \u2013 presentation methods.\n1. The Takahashi Method\n This extremely unique method calls for the use of very, very large text. The goal is to use no more than a handful (preferably, less than three) of easy-to-understand words, or a single image or photo with no accompanying words, on each slide, to deliver a very clear, very high-impact message in a very short period of time. Many believe that this approach forces the audience to listen to the speaker, since the slides alone do not demonstrate all the content to be delivered.\n2. The Lessig Method\n Based on the style of Stanford Law professor Lawrence Lessig, this method is quite similar to Takahashi\u2019s approach in its simplicity. Presenters who use this technique incorporate only a brief quote, a short sentence, or a photo with a caption onto their slides, and spend only a few seconds on each. But, while Takahashi-style presentations are often rather short \u2013 usually ten slides or less \u2013 Lessig presentations are often quite long, sometimes hundreds of slides that are passed through very quickly. The idea behind this method is that the rapid-fire pace of delivery prevents the audience from growing bored or getting distracted.\n3. The Godin Method\n Although not yet formally recognized by presentation pundits, this method, made popular by best-selling author and marketing guru Seth Godin, focuses mostly on the element of presentation slide design \u2013 particularly, how to select accompanying visuals to enhance messages appropriately. Godin promotes the use of bold fonts, contrasting colors, striking images, and other clear, compelling visuals to better convey thoughts and ideas.\n4. The Monta Method\n Like the Takahashi approach, this technique originated in Japan. Introduced by a knowledge worker in the tech field, it emulates the personality and charisma of a popular game show host. Presenters are encouraged to use questions and answers on all their visuals. When the question is posed to the audience, the answer is kept covered or hidden, only to be revealed once attendees have tried to \u201cguess\u201d. The advantage of this approach is that it is highly effective at keeping the audience interested and engaged, and thus, their attention is less likely to wander.\nThis is the continuation in a series of Incredible resources for presentations.

      "text": "I recently filmed a show for This Week in Venture Capital in which I talked about how to prepare for a VC meeting: whom you\u2019ll meet, who should attend from your side, what materials you should bring and how you should run the meeting. I wrote the summary notes in this blog post. That notes only told part of the story.\nBijan Sabet \u2013 investor & board member in some small  companies you might have heard of like Twitter, Tumblr, Boxee & OMGPOP \u2013 took issue with the whole notion that you even need a Powerpoint deck anymore. Please read his compelling & short post on the topic. The beautiful thing about VC\u2019s who blog is that they tell you their preferences before you pitch to them!\nHis key quote is,\n\u201cthere are a couple things in this particular post that don\u2019t work for me personally (every VC is different!).\nFirst, if it\u2019s an early stage company, I don\u2019t need to see a powerpoint deck. I\u2019m comfortable with introductions and then getting into the demo.\u201d\nHe\u2019s right that increasingly there is a tribe of investors who don\u2019t care to see your Powerpoint deck.\nI would argue that this mostly consists of consumer Internet companies (although not exclusively) and it is predominantly early-stage people who are product gurus and have a mildly technical bend to them. In VC there are the obvious people including Bijan, Brad Feld, Fred Wilson, Josh Kopelman and Bryce Roberts. I\u2019m sure there are many more. I would mostly lump me in that category. I\u2019m usually itching to just see what you\u2019ve built. I\u2019m a product geek more than a spreadsheet ninja.\nI talked about this in the TWiVC video but I didn\u2019t do a good enough job of writing it up in the summary notes in the post.\nAnd it\u2019s almost universally true that the new band of angels & seed investors are product gurus. Obvious examples include Chris Dixon, Keith Rabois, Aydin Senkut, Dave McClure, Chris Sacca, XG Ventures, Reid Hoffman and so on. If you get the chance to see any of these people (or similar who I\u2019m forgetting right now) you should. The product feedback will be invaluable.\nI believe in this so much that, despite my post advising you to be prepared for the *norm* in VC, I wrote a post about a company that came in for a presentation and never even got the slides out or presented a demo. I funded them 8 weeks later. I called the meeting a 10/10 because we had a great 90-minute discussion in which we had great rapport.\nSo why would I have talked so much about the deck in my post? Isn\u2019t it antithetical to my arguments above? And did I really just try to drop an SAT word into my blog post? No, the ideas aren\u2019t conflicting. Yes, two glasses of Syrah will make you want to use pretentious words that you wouldn\u2019t ordinarily say with a straight face.\nThe \u201cTriple Play\u201d of VC Presentations\nSo is the PowerPoint deck pass\u00e9? Can you just show up without one? Short answer \u2013 \u2018no.\u2019 You need to be prepared for the \u201cTriple Play.\u201d If you feel comfortable trying the no deck discussion \u2013 go for it. If you want to go quickly to the demo \u2013 knock yourself out. But take prompts from the VC. Not all of them are driving from product orientation, not all of them are early-stage, not all of them are consumer specialists.\nI think the norm in the industry is still to see Powerpoint slides and I wouldn\u2019t hold this against anybody. In reading the comments on Bijan\u2019s blog and having discussed this so many times, I know some entrepreneurs only want to talk with VCs that think that Powerpoint causes leprosy.\nThe reason I\u2019m more nuanced is that I believe that a well-crafted Powerpoint deck can actually set some context for what you\u2019re about to show the VC. It can orient you like a map so that when you look at product it is framed. And when you finish the demo you can bring in the other important components such as competition, team, customer acquisition strategy, etc. Powerpoint can be especially useful for platform businesses or B2B.\nConsumer? Mobile app? Just jump into the demo after intros. Bijan is right.\nThe best policy is to ask. Something like, \u201dI was thinking about jumping into the demo first before discussing the market. Does that work for you or would you prefer that I start with slides?\u201d And if you prefer a demo and they don\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t be dogmatic. Call an audible. Be ready to map your presentation to their preferred method.\nAct I \u2013 The Discussion:\nI think the negative reaction to Powerpoint from some VCs is that it usually becomes a crutch. Use it as a framework for a dialog not a script. Your goal in the meeting is to establish rapport and have a dialog that is participatory \u2013 meaning two-way. It\u2019s why I wrote that the best meetings are debates and not pitches. It\u2019s the same as in any sales-oriented meeting and make no mistake raising money is sales. In Bijan\u2019s post he references Bryce Roberts who recommends getting up and white-boarding. That\u2019s an awesome suggestion. The quote from Bryce is:\n\u201cWhen an entrepreneur steps to the whiteboard the energy in the room totally changes. There\u2019s movement, there\u2019s action, there\u2019s something happening that requires attention. The conversation moves from consuming images on a screen in lean back mode, to active engagement. Half baked ideas get refined, new ideas emerge and a two way dialoge develops where a one way monologue once was.\u201d\nBeautifully written. You want the VC speaking. The white board is a great way to make this happen. And he / she wants to hear how you really think, not the presentation you\u2019ve memorized. But if you\u2019re not the worlds best free-formed debater and prefer not to jump up to the white board, you can also do this with well placed and purposeful questions in a Powerpoint deck or demo.\nIn my opinion you need to establish rapport & credibility with the VC before you try to flip the meeting on them and ask them questions. It\u2019s subtle. But flip you must \u2013 just as in a sales meeting.\nUse something like, \u201cI noticed you invested in a couple of companies in the x,y,z space. Have you had similar experiences with them? Or has your experience with them proved counter to what our current thinking is?\u201d or some other similar way to engage them in speaking.\nNow here is the part that I don\u2019t believe can be taught. You need to be a good judge on whether you feel the VC is engaged with you. Does the conversation flow naturally? Are they asking you questions? Are they actively listening? Do they seem excited to answer the questions you have asked them?\nThe tell-tale signs that they\u2019re not engaged are: reading through papers in front of them, not asking you questions, no looking you in the eyes or looking at their watch (yes, this happens). But more subtly it\u2019s just an expression on their face that they\u2019re not having fun.\nRemember that 90% of all communications are non verbal. You need to pay attention. If you\u2019re not \u201cfeeling it\u201d then you need to shift to the slides or demo quickly as a means of trying to engage. If you find yourself in this situation I recommend you politely ask, \u201cwould you like me to carry on telling you about the company or would it be helpful if I went through our PowerPoint slides or do you prefer that I start with a demo?\u201d\nVery few people ask. I recommend it. Let them guide you.\nAct II \u2013 The Deck\nSo your goal is to create a dialog \u2013 white board, free form or otherwise \u2013 but a large % of VC will prefer that start off with or involve a PowerPoint deck. The majority, I would guess. So on any given day you need to be ready for Act II. The reason for this is that most VC\u2019s still want to get oriented in some way and the established norm for this happens to be the PowerPoint deck covering: What problem are you solving? What does your solution do? How big is the market? Who are your key customers? Competitors? How do you make money? What are you 3 year projections?\nDo not be put off by direct questions that are fired at you as you present. Again, 90% of communication is non verbal. If you seem annoyed with the questions or get defensive it will establish negative rapport. View the questions as engagement. Maybe they could have used more tact but at least they\u2019re involved in the discussion. If you\u2019re asked a tough question and you\u2019re not sure if you answered in a way that they expected don\u2019t be afraid to say, \u201dThat\u2019s obviously a tough question. I\u2019d love to hear you point of view on X topic. Do you see it a different way?\u201d\nGet through Act II as quickly as you can. You really want to get to the demo.\nAct III \u2013 The Demo\nIn addition to getting quickly through your slides you also need to be prepared for the VC who wants you to get straight to a product demo. Bjian has made it clear he\u2019s in this camp. I find this is more often an ex operator VC and often somebody who deep down is a product guy, like Bijan. I find myself wanting to get to product demos pretty quickly, too. I get too bored with abstract slides. But admittedly for some topics I like some orientation about the market before I see the product.\nIf you LEAD with the demo, I\u2019d encourage you to be prepared to weave through all of the key messages that would have been discussed if you were in your PowerPoint slides but get them out as you walk through your demo. DO NOT make it a features & functions presentation. Unfortunately most people do.\n\u201cHere\u2019s how you upload a document. Here\u2019s how you add tags. Here\u2019s how you notify a user. Here\u2019s how you vote up / down their content.\u201d\nLame. You\u2019re showing them features, not value. Value is when you frame the demo in terms of why it solves somebody\u2019s true pain point. You know the cliche \u2013 it needs to be medicine, not aspirin. I recommend that you make your demo \u201ca day in the life of\u201d your key user persona. Present from the user\u2019s point-of-view.\n\u201cLet me show you how a user would do X. In today\u2019s world without our solution they have to enter this information in 3 separate places, which is both time-consuming and leads to errors. Our solution cuts down on both. Let me show you how we would do A, B, C using OurSolution and now let me show you how they do it before OurCo.\u201d\nTalk about the customer problem and how you solve it. Talk about the existing solutions, the market opportunity and the competition. Weave all your key messages through the demo. If you can give the equivalent of our PowerPoint slides while conducting the demo that\u2019s the best outcome. I wrote a very specific separate post on how to nail a demo.\nSome final thoughts:\n- Not everybody is good with impromptu discussions. If you\u2019re not then stick to just the intros and break out your slides. Make sure that in your slides you\u2019re not racing through them but using them as a way to engage in the discussion in a way that puts you more in your comfort zone\n- If you\u2019re good with white boards and one exists \u2013 go for it. It\u2019s a wonderful way to show how you think, your ability to lead, your raw intelligence to debate and it\u2019s a great way to get others speaking. Not everybody is a natural at this. In my opinion it\u2019s kind of like telling jokes, don\u2019t go for it if it\u2019s not your strength\n- On the other hand, if you\u2019re not good at giving demo\u2019s you\u2019re going to have to learn to be. Practice. Get feedback. Find great presenters and have them hear your pitch. Giving great demo\u2019s matters in every part of your business operations. The kiss of death is the CEO who says to me, \u201cI\u2019m not good at demo\u2019s \u2013 my product guys never let me do them\u201d (you\u2019d be surprised at how often this gets said). If you\u2019re not intimate with the product it\u2019s hard for me to buy that you\u2019re going to be a successful tech entrepreneur.\nWorse yet some people say, \u201cI\u2019m going to set up a follow up meeting to have my sales guy walk you through the product.\u201d Um \u2026 no thanks.",

I would argue that this mostly consists of consumer Internet companies (although not exclusively) and it is predominantly early-stage people who are product gurus and have a mildly technical bend to them...

      "text": "In about a week and a half (March 7, to be exact), Rand and I will be road-tripping to Portland to attend SEMpdx's day conference, SearchFest. Rand has reached a near-godlike status in the conference sphere, in that he was asked to speak at the conference and is allowed to pick a topic of his choosing. As a result, Rand will be performing his one-man show, \"Fishkin: Whitehat, Hopeless Romantic, and Hobo Stabber.\" There will, of course, be a 15-minute Q&A following his performance, but you can only ask a question when he's thrown you a Koosh ball.\n Seriously though, Rand will be on a panel with Small Business SEM extraordinaire Matt McGee and some dude (dudette?) with a seriously wicked name (Stoney deGeyter) to discuss Advanced SEO Topics (check out the SearchFest agenda for a complete schedule of sessions being offered).\n So, why am I attending the conference with Rand? It's not because I am his lackey, the Tattoo to his Mr. Roarke...okay, well maybe that's partly why. Actually, I'll also be there for my very first speaking engagement. I'll be on the Link Development panel with Scott Fish and Benjamin Lloyd. And holy crap, I have to have a 15-minute presentation. With, like, slides. And I have to present first. And there's a 15-minute Q&A afterwards. Basically, I'm doing a presentation twice as long as anything I ever did in college, and it'll be in front of roughly 2-10x the audience. Hmmm, I wonder if I can get that SES London plague that had been circulating the conference...\n Also, apparently there are still some exhibitor spots available for the conference. It costs $500 to exhibit ($350 if you're an SEMpdx member), or you can join SEMpdx for $100, exhibit for $350, and get a free admission pass in the process, thus saving you fifty bucks. That's some crazy math right there (but what do I know, I'm a liberal arts alum). If you're interested in exhibiting, then get on it because the spots are filling up!\n Also, if you're a fervent fan of the blog and are planning on attending the conference, be sure to go on a coffee break between 2:00 and 3:00 pm so you won't be subjected to seeing me standing at the podium drenched in sweat sporting a look of sheer terror.

Try to keep druplicon and the word Drupal at the same proportions as in the druplicon sourcefile, don't scale them independently.\n - Which typeface are you using for the body text?\n - Would have been nice to see a slide template based on the default Garland theme.\n - White backgrounds are very harsh on the eyes, I'd like to see a variation with tinted backgroundcolor\n1: looks like you are showing a cropped view of a all 4 rounded corners slide. Centered heading is not so good, better to keep this left aligned, works much better with long, wrapping titles. I'm not a fan of the putting the logo real big and faded in the background trick in general. A nice and clean rounded corner design would surely be nice though.\n2: slide two: no rotating the text please! logo top left makes it too prominent.\n3: better. efficient. Not sure about the yellow. There's so little of it, it almost looks like a stain. I think you should choose this one to do some more variations with. aclight is right thoug about the loss of screenspace especially with 2 coumn layouts.\n4: I advise to just keep the title left aligned. The waves are ok, but why fade them out with a gradient? (bottom one). I like the wave better directly on the white as it is behind the title. If you want to do some more work on 4/5 I'd suggest using a wave only along the bottom. These are really subtle lines though, have a look at how you could make it workd with the more robust and solid Drupal logo. tinted background could work great, use whites for the wave, etc.\n5: Title is unreadable like this. 4 is better.\nso, I'd say work on option 3 OR 4 some more. Better not combine elements from the different designs but pick one direction and progress from there.",

      "text": "Over the past few years, I\u2019ve been invited to come speak at various events. No big surprise there, as I\u2019ve probably met a bunch of you at them. Since there\u2019s a chance that some are publicly speaking for the first time in Austin this year, I figured I\u2019d share a few things I\u2019ve tried along the way.\nThese tips will probably be more relevant if you\u2019re a nervous talker and you suspect you won\u2019t fill in enough time. (If you\u2019re a rambler, there are other people who can offer you far better advice than I.) It\u2019s timely in a way, because I think I\u2019ve finally crossed a threshold in my own speaking. I started off early 2004 in a bit of a fluster, went into overdrive preparation mode during most of 2005, and now in 2006, I think I\u2019m easing into speaking naturally and comfortably. Finally.\nWhen I first started, I wasn\u2019t sure how to plan for time constraints. Speaking for an hour seemed like a long time to keep going, and there was always a good chance I\u2019d miss important points along the way and end really early.\nSo I approached my preparation as if I were writing an article, which would take approximately an hour to read out loud. I\u2019d hole up in a cafe and breeze through a logical progression of thoughts that ended up being 10 pages or more of printed text, and try to separate that out into smaller bite-sized points for easier scanning when presenting. Then I\u2019d build slides based on that. It was a lot of work.\nNot only was I concerned about the time constraints though, I also got spooked out of allowing myself to ramble at all. I\u2019ve talked through three slides past the one that\u2019s currently on screen, only to madly catch up later. I\u2019ve realized halfway through that I didn\u2019t make a bunch of important points earlier to help support the current slide, so it in turn makes no sense without that context. I\u2019ve even gotten completely stuck from time to time, I think the most notable was on stage at WE04. \u201cUh, I completely forgot where I was going with that\u2026\u201d So to help myself avoid any repeats, I\u2019ve been meticulous in my preparation and made sure to have the entire presentation outlined, with a paper backup on hand, to ensure I could talk my way out of any glitches.\nBut that spiraled out of control, since every time I presented I tried to deliver new material, adapted to the theme of the conference. And thus, new supporting material. Not such a hot idea, I found out, as it\u2019s probably more important to be familiar with your material and comfortable when delivering it, than to be fresh all the time. Not to mention the extra time and effort creating a new set of slides every single time.\nSo recently, I\u2019ve realized a few things that I think are making me a better speaker. I\u2019ve stopped spending ages coming up with finely-detailed outlines of each presentation, and instead I\u2019m leaving more to real-time interaction. I\u2019m still no Veen or Molly, and likely will never be, but at least I\u2019m comfortable in my own methods now, and I think that\u2019s the real key to presenting well.\nKnow your material. But plan to make mistakes anyway. If you talk through a bunch of slides, oh well. Make them available later, and it\u2019s no big deal. If you have to back up and provide extra context that you missed earlier, go right ahead. You can even tell people that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing, although you probably don\u2019t need to. Also, if you\u2019re more of a bullet-point presenter, you can even use your slides as notes to keep you focused throughout. That\u2019s hardly a bad system, though we all know why PowerPoint is evil\u2026\nNervousness goes away. Five minutes into it, you\u2019ll stop being nervous and start having a bit more fun. And after doing a few presentations, you\u2019ll stop getting those butterflies in your stomach before hand, and feel a lot more at home on a stage.\nPause. Get used to taking small pauses here and there, to take a sip of water, to collect your thoughts, to slow yourself down, or whatever else. It\u2019s okay to have a few seconds of silence.\nHave a water bottle with you on stage. You\u2019ll need it for the dry mouth. Some lip balm might not be a bad idea either, if you\u2019re talking more than once.\nIf you get stuck on-stage, it\u2019s not a bad thing. You simply move on to the next topic. The audience might notice, or they might not. A lot of the things you\u2019re thinking internally during that moment will never get picked up by anyone else, so if what you\u2019re saying still makes some form of sense, chances are no one will catch it. (And if it doesn\u2019t make sense, often that\u2019s just glossed over! Not everyone is 100% coherent all the time when speaking, and it rarely matters.)\nBe prepared to allow for spontaneity. You can\u2019t really plan for the asides and diversions that you might make while on stage, but allow them to happen when they do. Often you\u2019ll explore a related idea that ties in with your main points nicely, and it\u2019ll work its way into future presentations. Try to keep yourself always coming back to the topic at hand, or at the very least, make sure to highlight why your diversion is relevant to the discussion. Don\u2019t spend too long on them, however.\nHave a lot of slides. If you\u2019re worried about time, just make sure you\u2019ve got more material than you need. Chances are you won\u2019t get through it all, but that\u2019s not a terrible problem to have. I\u2019d say 40 to 50 slides is probably enough to fill up an entire hour, as that\u2019s just over a minute each. As you get more comfortable, you can start bringing that number down.\nBe prepared, but it\u2019s not worth killing yourself. Don\u2019t go for broke on the slides, go for broke on familiarizing yourself with your topic and your slides. Do three dry runs before you get up on stage. Time yourself, and don\u2019t try to back up and re-try anything during the dry runs. Learn how to talk your way out of a factual error you just caught, speaking flub, or even just simple mispronunciation. Pretend there\u2019s an audience right in front of you and you only have that hour. This will quickly highlight the problem points, and often it\u2019ll cause you to re-arrange your slides.\nIf you don\u2019t fill the entire hour, no big deal. (If you\u2019re only hitting the 30 minute mark, you might need to have more material next time.) Q&A can usually fill up the rest of your time slot, and ever since I\u2019ve started speaking I\u2019ve had more fun answering questions than talking during the actual presentation. Try to make your talk amenable to follow-up questions, and if you\u2019ve got a small enough room (anything over 50 people is pushing it) you can even encourage questions throughout.\nMake sure you\u2019ve got a strong start, and the rest will fall into place. The first few minutes are the most important. The audience doesn\u2019t know what you\u2019re like, you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re like, so you need to get people interested. Plus, the sea of quiet faces is a bit overwhelming, so if you need to script any part of your presentation, this is the best part to script. After you\u2019ve gone through the introduction and started getting into the meat of it, people are likely to be more receptive and you won\u2019t feel so on the spot.\nRe-use material. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with this. If you\u2019re giving repeat presentations, feel free to dip into past talks and pull out points. I lean towards illustrated slides instead of bullet points these days, so I\u2019ve even built up an illustration library which I\u2019ll happily re-use for new talks, even if the subject matter changes.\nOf course SXSW is more oriented toward 15 or 20 minutes of talking, so the time frame is a bit different. But chances are sooner or later you\u2019ll need to talk for an hour or so. Hopefully you\u2019ll be a natural, but if not, maybe these tips will help.",

Often, I make absolutely no reference at all to the joke in the slide.\nFor instance, in my most recent demo presentation, I had a slide with the text \"ASP.NET MVC\" centered that I was talking over about how I was using the framework. In a smaller font, I had the text \"Catchy name, huh?\". When I did that demo live, that slide got a chuckle. It's not stand-up worthy by any stretch of the imagination, but we're often presenting some pretty dry stuff and every little bit helps.\nSimilarly, I've included slides that are just plain snarky comments from the offscreen guy about what I'm planning to say. So, I'll say, \"The codebase for this project needed a little help\", while the slide behind me said \"It was a pile of spaghetti with 3 meatballs, actually\" and a plate of spaghetti as the slide background. Again, with no comment from me and just moving on to the next slide as though I didn't even see it actually made it funnier.\nThat can also be a help if you don't have the best comedic timing by taking the pressure off while still adding some levity.\nAnyway, what it really comes down to is that I've been doing most of my demo/presentation work just like I would if it was a screencast and then substituting the live version of me (pausing the video as appropriate if things go off the rails) for the audio when I give it in front of an audience.\nOf course, you can then easily make the real presentation available afterward for those who want it.\nFor the slides, I generally go out of my way to not say the exact words on the screen more often than not.",

Therefore, a recent post on HubSpot is a must read for anyone who needs to prepare a PowerPoint presentation.\nHubSpot noted that Duarte Design, a Silicon Valley design shop, recently put on a slidelogy workshop which contained a wealth of useful information about putting together awesome PowerPoint presentations. From that workshop, HubSpot came up with these 10 key but simple rules for better presentations:\nNo bullets\nStart on paper\nThe 30pt rule\nNo starbursts\nOne thought per slide\nTime-limits, not slide-limits\nOne thought per slide\nNo logo on every slide\nNo chart junk\nTell a story\nAnd as a great follow-up to this post that was written at the request of readers, HubSpot has a second post containing 17 examples of great presentations. These presentations will give you a fairly good idea as to what a great presentation design is and isn't.",

      "text": "According to research done by the Mahatma Gandhi Medical College in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India, using PowerPoint presentations to explain concepts to medical students is the method preferred by the students. Since medical techniques, like closing cuts in the skin with sutures, are visually intensive, the use of clear, compelling images in a PowerPoint presentation can aid learning.\nThe 10/20/30 Rule\nRenowned presentation expert Guy Kawasaki suggests that presentations consist of 10 slides, be no more than 20 minutes in length and use a font that is no smaller than 30 point. The idea is that PowerPoint presentations provide an additional, visual channel of communication. As such, it should be used to highlight images that accompany the message. Each image should present a distinct idea clearly pertinent to the topic and not unnecessarily repeating the information from other images. For example, show pictures of simple interrupted sutures as compared to simple running sutures. You will vocally describe the finer details of the technique, but the PowerPoint presentation can support your words with clear pictures. Keep the presentation short so that the information can be absorbed and applied.\nFull-Screen Images\nGarr Reynolds, the author of Presentation Zen, recommends using full bleed images; that is pictures that take up the whole screen in the PowerPoint presentation. Don't show the wound being closed with a vertical mattress suture in a small picture surrounded by white space or border graphics that may be decorative but carry no information. Rather, fill the screen with a clear picture. Human brains are primarily visual, so if the image of the suture technique is strongly associated with the content being taught, it's more likely that the students will understand and apply the suturing technique.\nHumanize the Experience\nOne of the key rules highlighted in Dr. John Medina's book \"Brain Rules\" is that we don't pay attention to boring things. Use the story of the surgery or the wound to connect the students to the act of suturing a human being. When the decision is made to apply a half-buried vertical mattress suture, it will likely be on the face of a person who has feelings and a story. Students will engage with the lesson on suturing techniques not only mentally but also emotionally, and subsequently, will be better prepared for the actual task.\nWhen to Stop Using PowerPoint\nWhile PowerPoint is good at presenting a visual overview of the different techniques involved in wound closure, it isn't ideally suited to giving the specific steps for each stitch. Think of PowerPoint as providing an aerial view of the topic so that students can understand the many different types of suturing techniques. Once this overview is in place, hands-on experience is a better teacher for the ground-level information.\n Related Searches\nReferences\nResources\nPhoto Credit Hemera Technologies/AbleStock.com/Getty Images",

      "text": "If you want to create a PowerPoint presentation on different types of security guards, you must employ effective presentation strategies and thorough research. According to renowned visual communication expert Edward Tufte, PowerPoint is \"evil,\" primarily due to its tendency to favor bullet points over visual communication. When discussing security guard types, avoid being \"evil\" and let the images speak loudly.\nThe 10 20 30 Rule\nAccording to Guy Kawasaki, an expert presenter, PowerPoint presentations should contain no more than 10 slides, be no longer than 20 minutes and use text that is no smaller than 30 point font. This emphasizes the visual over the textual aspects of communication. So, if you want to present a bank security guard, use a picture of a guard in a bank instead of a bullet point list outlining the details of what such a guard is expected to do. You will still provide the details of a guard's duties, but in a verbal form, rather than in the PowerPoint presentation itself. Reserve the specific details about duties and requirements for your narration and a printed handout that can be given to the audience after the presentation is over.\nBrain Rules\nNeuroscientist Dr. John Medina has summarized brain research into several rules that can aid presenters. Primarily, humans are visually oriented and won't pay attention to \"boring\" information. Lists of facts and figures are sure to bore an audience wanting to learn about security guard types, but an image of a guard in action accompanied, by a story about how the guard was able to help people, will create a visual-emotional connection with the audience, ensuring that the information is retained longer than if only text were presented in the PowerPoint. According to Medina, an image that supports narration can increase the retention and comprehension of the subject sixfold.\nSecurity Guard Requirements\nAccording to the California Bureau of Security and Investigative Services, security guards may be armed or unarmed, and the armament may be with a firearm, tear gas or a baton. Guards must be licensed to carry any of these weapons in addition to being trained by the state. All security guards must be licensed according to the standards of the state or country in which they plan to work. Additionally, security guards may be required to pass background checks that are more stringent than those for other jobs, including being free from any criminal conviction and passing substance abuse tests.\nSecurity Guard Types\nIn the Occupational Outlook Handbook for 2010-11, the United States Bureau of Labor and Statistics sees that the job opportunities for security guards will be favorable, but competitive. Guards may provide physical protection for retails stores, banks or offices; security guards may also be employed to offer surveillance protection for offices, neighborhoods, retail parking lots and casinos. Typically, the pay for a security guard will increase with the risk of the job and the experience of the guard. Patrol-and-report type jobs such as those in neighborhood and retail settings are the lowest on the risk and pay scales. At the opposite end of the spectrum, a personal security guard duty for high-profile individuals traveling in dangerous locations needs experience and training in weapons, driving and surveillance, but the compensation is commensurate with these stringent requirements.\n Related Searches\nReferences\nResources\nPhoto Credit Thinkstock Images/Comstock/Getty Images",

I remember the first comment was something along the lines 'Why would anybody want to buy an e-book 99% of which suck anyways, if they can get the new Harry Potter with x sites for just y bucks?'.\nAs the thread continued somebody mentioned (not sure maybe it was the same person?) that the only one who was successful with that was a certain author of an e-book on SEO ;-).\nThat first comment made me think of your threads about how important packaging is (and marketing books I had read). Sell the same information as an e-book not an ordinary book and that particular person (and probably many more) will associate less value with it, b/c there are many wack e-books out there.\nHowever, I remember myself ordering another e-book (not on SEO), too, which I did buy because it was unique and the copywriting was strong.\nI think in most cases selling an e-book as opposed to an ordinary book might prove difficult, b/c many people associate it with little value, but if your information is a) really unique or b)updated (which turns the e-book format into an advantage instead of a disadvantage) :-) it can work out.\nAnd if c) you have an exceptionally strong brand/ a well-known name, I bet it would be pretty likely to work out...I think if somebody with a brand and a following as strong as Guy Kawasaki wrote a book and published it only as an e-book he'd still have TONS of people buying it and the possibly lower number of sales would probably be more than off-set by a profit margin of close to 100%. Think about Seth Godin starting to publish his books only as e-books. People would continue to buy them b/c of his strong brand (though maybe less)\nActually, I think every book author should make his book available as an e-book and sell it for a bit cheaper to tap into the segment of people who are not opposed to buying an e-book/the greedy (or less wealthy) people segment..it would sell at a lower price, but their profit margin would still make each e-book sale a lot more profitable than the sale of a normal book and I bet some people would buy the (cheaper) e-book instead...and having the e-book out as an ordinary book would probbaly lend the e-book credibility, too.\nPlus they could give the e-book to people who order the book as a bonus..so they can start reading 5 seconds after purchasing the book even though they want to have the paper version on their shelves (might especially help with people ordering from overseas who'd have to wait long).\nDo you know other people who are making good money by selling e-books? What helps them succeed? unique content? a strong brand?",

      "text": "Topic: Advertising/PR\n This question has been answered, and points have been awarded.\nVideo Humour And Case Studies To Support Sales Seminars\n I'm hoping you can help me with a test project for a new client. The client is based in the financial services sector and run regular seminars and events attended by their key sales directors/executives. I've been asked to look at ways I can make these events more memorable. In particular they would like to bring some humour into the presentations with the use of video and radio. Here is what I'm looking for.\n- Best examples of short sales videos (i.e. John Cleese from Monty Python fame who also produced some training videos) with the possibility they could be adapted to suit the client and the target audience. The objective is to bring a more light-hearted approach to the sales programmes and make them memorable for all the right reasons. If successful they could be developed for a follow on viral campaign.\n- Examples of case studies. The clients key customers are primarily Managing Directors from small/medium sized companies with an annual turnover of around \u00a35 million. Another area they are keen for me to help them with is how best they can generate case studies from their customer base. The case studies will be included within the seminars and used for future marketing promotions as appropriate. Consequently, I'm after any examples/links of engaging case studies on video or radio.\n- What makes a brilliant case study and do you have to use real people/customers or can you make up a case study with the use actors?\n- Any other suggestions to enhance a sales event and make the attendees keen to seek out more information.\nAny examples, direct links to resources, advice and recommendations will be a great help.\nThank you\n First of all, a Case Study is - or certainly should be - a real life, verifiable example of the success of a product or service.\nIf it's meaningful humor you want, it must be logically and naturally woven into the presentation by the presented. To merely break up a presentation with a funny video won't do the job.\nHope those comments help.\nPhil\n Many thanks to all of you for the response regarding my new project and found the comments very useful. Can I also offer my apologies for a late reply but I had to go away for a little while on family business. Fully appreciate thoughts about humour but was really after a few examples you may have come across and remembered for all the right reasons. I guess a good trawl on youtube is probably the best option. A strategy for finding the right case studies may be a little more difficult. Any further ideas on this, most welcome\nPost a Comment",

We get 3 full levels of engagement with the attendee: the verbal/audio, summarized with a Main Idea, with a Key Word or two to punch out. A note of caution: we've found if the text of a slide precedes the audio, even by a partial second, a slight mental confusion results. We believe that the attendee leads their perception with the audio, and the visual needs to follow - to exemplify, to summarize, to highlight.

      "text": "Over the past few years, I\u2019ve been invited to come speak at various events. No big surprise there, as I\u2019ve probably met a bunch of you at them. Since there\u2019s a chance that some are publicly speaking for the first time in Austin this year, I figured I\u2019d share a few things I\u2019ve tried along the way.\nThese tips will probably be more relevant if you\u2019re a nervous talker and you suspect you won\u2019t fill in enough time. (If you\u2019re a rambler, there are other people who can offer you far better advice than I.) It\u2019s timely in a way, because I think I\u2019ve finally crossed a threshold in my own speaking. I started off early 2004 in a bit of a fluster, went into overdrive preparation mode during most of 2005, and now in 2006, I think I\u2019m easing into speaking naturally and comfortably. Finally.\nWhen I first started, I wasn\u2019t sure how to plan for time constraints. Speaking for an hour seemed like a long time to keep going, and there was always a good chance I\u2019d miss important points along the way and end really early.\nSo I approached my preparation as if I were writing an article, which would take approximately an hour to read out loud. I\u2019d hole up in a cafe and breeze through a logical progression of thoughts that ended up being 10 pages or more of printed text, and try to separate that out into smaller bite-sized points for easier scanning when presenting. Then I\u2019d build slides based on that. It was a lot of work.\nNot only was I concerned about the time constraints though, I also got spooked out of allowing myself to ramble at all. I\u2019ve talked through three slides past the one that\u2019s currently on screen, only to madly catch up later. I\u2019ve realized halfway through that I didn\u2019t make a bunch of important points earlier to help support the current slide, so it in turn makes no sense without that context. I\u2019ve even gotten completely stuck from time to time, I think the most notable was on stage at WE04. \u201cUh, I completely forgot where I was going with that\u2026\u201d So to help myself avoid any repeats, I\u2019ve been meticulous in my preparation and made sure to have the entire presentation outlined, with a paper backup on hand, to ensure I could talk my way out of any glitches.\nBut that spiraled out of control, since every time I presented I tried to deliver new material, adapted to the theme of the conference. And thus, new supporting material. Not such a hot idea, I found out, as it\u2019s probably more important to be familiar with your material and comfortable when delivering it, than to be fresh all the time. Not to mention the extra time and effort creating a new set of slides every single time.\nSo recently, I\u2019ve realized a few things that I think are making me a better speaker. I\u2019ve stopped spending ages coming up with finely-detailed outlines of each presentation, and instead I\u2019m leaving more to real-time interaction. I\u2019m still no Veen or Molly, and likely will never be, but at least I\u2019m comfortable in my own methods now, and I think that\u2019s the real key to presenting well.\nKnow your material. But plan to make mistakes anyway. If you talk through a bunch of slides, oh well. Make them available later, and it\u2019s no big deal. If you have to back up and provide extra context that you missed earlier, go right ahead. You can even tell people that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing, although you probably don\u2019t need to. Also, if you\u2019re more of a bullet-point presenter, you can even use your slides as notes to keep you focused throughout. That\u2019s hardly a bad system, though we all know why PowerPoint is evil\u2026\nNervousness goes away. Five minutes into it, you\u2019ll stop being nervous and start having a bit more fun. And after doing a few presentations, you\u2019ll stop getting those butterflies in your stomach before hand, and feel a lot more at home on a stage.\nPause. Get used to taking small pauses here and there, to take a sip of water, to collect your thoughts, to slow yourself down, or whatever else. It\u2019s okay to have a few seconds of silence.\nHave a water bottle with you on stage. You\u2019ll need it for the dry mouth. Some lip balm might not be a bad idea either, if you\u2019re talking more than once.\nIf you get stuck on-stage, it\u2019s not a bad thing. You simply move on to the next topic. The audience might notice, or they might not. A lot of the things you\u2019re thinking internally during that moment will never get picked up by anyone else, so if what you\u2019re saying still makes some form of sense, chances are no one will catch it. (And if it doesn\u2019t make sense, often that\u2019s just glossed over! Not everyone is 100% coherent all the time when speaking, and it rarely matters.)\nBe prepared to allow for spontaneity. You can\u2019t really plan for the asides and diversions that you might make while on stage, but allow them to happen when they do. Often you\u2019ll explore a related idea that ties in with your main points nicely, and it\u2019ll work its way into future presentations. Try to keep yourself always coming back to the topic at hand, or at the very least, make sure to highlight why your diversion is relevant to the discussion. Don\u2019t spend too long on them, however.\nHave a lot of slides. If you\u2019re worried about time, just make sure you\u2019ve got more material than you need. Chances are you won\u2019t get through it all, but that\u2019s not a terrible problem to have. I\u2019d say 40 to 50 slides is probably enough to fill up an entire hour, as that\u2019s just over a minute each. As you get more comfortable, you can start bringing that number down.\nBe prepared, but it\u2019s not worth killing yourself. Don\u2019t go for broke on the slides, go for broke on familiarizing yourself with your topic and your slides. Do three dry runs before you get up on stage. Time yourself, and don\u2019t try to back up and re-try anything during the dry runs. Learn how to talk your way out of a factual error you just caught, speaking flub, or even just simple mispronunciation. Pretend there\u2019s an audience right in front of you and you only have that hour. This will quickly highlight the problem points, and often it\u2019ll cause you to re-arrange your slides.\nIf you don\u2019t fill the entire hour, no big deal. (If you\u2019re only hitting the 30 minute mark, you might need to have more material next time.) Q&A can usually fill up the rest of your time slot, and ever since I\u2019ve started speaking I\u2019ve had more fun answering questions than talking during the actual presentation. Try to make your talk amenable to follow-up questions, and if you\u2019ve got a small enough room (anything over 50 people is pushing it) you can even encourage questions throughout.\nMake sure you\u2019ve got a strong start, and the rest will fall into place. The first few minutes are the most important. The audience doesn\u2019t know what you\u2019re like, you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re like, so you need to get people interested. Plus, the sea of quiet faces is a bit overwhelming, so if you need to script any part of your presentation, this is the best part to script. After you\u2019ve gone through the introduction and started getting into the meat of it, people are likely to be more receptive and you won\u2019t feel so on the spot.\nRe-use material. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with this. If you\u2019re giving repeat presentations, feel free to dip into past talks and pull out points. I lean towards illustrated slides instead of bullet points these days, so I\u2019ve even built up an illustration library which I\u2019ll happily re-use for new talks, even if the subject matter changes.\nOf course SXSW is more oriented toward 15 or 20 minutes of talking, so the time frame is a bit different. But chances are sooner or later you\u2019ll need to talk for an hour or so. Hopefully you\u2019ll be a natural, but if not, maybe these tips will help.",

      "text": "Over the past few years, I\u2019ve been invited to come speak at various events. No big surprise there, as I\u2019ve probably met a bunch of you at them. Since there\u2019s a chance that some are publicly speaking for the first time in Austin this year, I figured I\u2019d share a few things I\u2019ve tried along the way.\nThese tips will probably be more relevant if you\u2019re a nervous talker and you suspect you won\u2019t fill in enough time. (If you\u2019re a rambler, there are other people who can offer you far better advice than I.) It\u2019s timely in a way, because I think I\u2019ve finally crossed a threshold in my own speaking. I started off early 2004 in a bit of a fluster, went into overdrive preparation mode during most of 2005, and now in 2006, I think I\u2019m easing into speaking naturally and comfortably. Finally.\nWhen I first started, I wasn\u2019t sure how to plan for time constraints. Speaking for an hour seemed like a long time to keep going, and there was always a good chance I\u2019d miss important points along the way and end really early.\nSo I approached my preparation as if I were writing an article, which would take approximately an hour to read out loud. I\u2019d hole up in a cafe and breeze through a logical progression of thoughts that ended up being 10 pages or more of printed text, and try to separate that out into smaller bite-sized points for easier scanning when presenting. Then I\u2019d build slides based on that. It was a lot of work.\nNot only was I concerned about the time constraints though, I also got spooked out of allowing myself to ramble at all. I\u2019ve talked through three slides past the one that\u2019s currently on screen, only to madly catch up later. I\u2019ve realized halfway through that I didn\u2019t make a bunch of important points earlier to help support the current slide, so it in turn makes no sense without that context. I\u2019ve even gotten completely stuck from time to time, I think the most notable was on stage at WE04. \u201cUh, I completely forgot where I was going with that\u2026\u201d So to help myself avoid any repeats, I\u2019ve been meticulous in my preparation and made sure to have the entire presentation outlined, with a paper backup on hand, to ensure I could talk my way out of any glitches.\nBut that spiraled out of control, since every time I presented I tried to deliver new material, adapted to the theme of the conference. And thus, new supporting material. Not such a hot idea, I found out, as it\u2019s probably more important to be familiar with your material and comfortable when delivering it, than to be fresh all the time. Not to mention the extra time and effort creating a new set of slides every single time.\nSo recently, I\u2019ve realized a few things that I think are making me a better speaker. I\u2019ve stopped spending ages coming up with finely-detailed outlines of each presentation, and instead I\u2019m leaving more to real-time interaction. I\u2019m still no Veen or Molly, and likely will never be, but at least I\u2019m comfortable in my own methods now, and I think that\u2019s the real key to presenting well.\nKnow your material. But plan to make mistakes anyway. If you talk through a bunch of slides, oh well. Make them available later, and it\u2019s no big deal. If you have to back up and provide extra context that you missed earlier, go right ahead. You can even tell people that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing, although you probably don\u2019t need to. Also, if you\u2019re more of a bullet-point presenter, you can even use your slides as notes to keep you focused throughout. That\u2019s hardly a bad system, though we all know why PowerPoint is evil\u2026\nNervousness goes away. Five minutes into it, you\u2019ll stop being nervous and start having a bit more fun. And after doing a few presentations, you\u2019ll stop getting those butterflies in your stomach before hand, and feel a lot more at home on a stage.\nPause. Get used to taking small pauses here and there, to take a sip of water, to collect your thoughts, to slow yourself down, or whatever else. It\u2019s okay to have a few seconds of silence.\nHave a water bottle with you on stage. You\u2019ll need it for the dry mouth. Some lip balm might not be a bad idea either, if you\u2019re talking more than once.\nIf you get stuck on-stage, it\u2019s not a bad thing. You simply move on to the next topic. The audience might notice, or they might not. A lot of the things you\u2019re thinking internally during that moment will never get picked up by anyone else, so if what you\u2019re saying still makes some form of sense, chances are no one will catch it. (And if it doesn\u2019t make sense, often that\u2019s just glossed over! Not everyone is 100% coherent all the time when speaking, and it rarely matters.)\nBe prepared to allow for spontaneity. You can\u2019t really plan for the asides and diversions that you might make while on stage, but allow them to happen when they do. Often you\u2019ll explore a related idea that ties in with your main points nicely, and it\u2019ll work its way into future presentations. Try to keep yourself always coming back to the topic at hand, or at the very least, make sure to highlight why your diversion is relevant to the discussion. Don\u2019t spend too long on them, however.\nHave a lot of slides. If you\u2019re worried about time, just make sure you\u2019ve got more material than you need. Chances are you won\u2019t get through it all, but that\u2019s not a terrible problem to have. I\u2019d say 40 to 50 slides is probably enough to fill up an entire hour, as that\u2019s just over a minute each. As you get more comfortable, you can start bringing that number down.\nBe prepared, but it\u2019s not worth killing yourself. Don\u2019t go for broke on the slides, go for broke on familiarizing yourself with your topic and your slides. Do three dry runs before you get up on stage. Time yourself, and don\u2019t try to back up and re-try anything during the dry runs. Learn how to talk your way out of a factual error you just caught, speaking flub, or even just simple mispronunciation. Pretend there\u2019s an audience right in front of you and you only have that hour. This will quickly highlight the problem points, and often it\u2019ll cause you to re-arrange your slides.\nIf you don\u2019t fill the entire hour, no big deal. (If you\u2019re only hitting the 30 minute mark, you might need to have more material next time.) Q&A can usually fill up the rest of your time slot, and ever since I\u2019ve started speaking I\u2019ve had more fun answering questions than talking during the actual presentation. Try to make your talk amenable to follow-up questions, and if you\u2019ve got a small enough room (anything over 50 people is pushing it) you can even encourage questions throughout.\nMake sure you\u2019ve got a strong start, and the rest will fall into place. The first few minutes are the most important. The audience doesn\u2019t know what you\u2019re like, you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re like, so you need to get people interested. Plus, the sea of quiet faces is a bit overwhelming, so if you need to script any part of your presentation, this is the best part to script. After you\u2019ve gone through the introduction and started getting into the meat of it, people are likely to be more receptive and you won\u2019t feel so on the spot.\nRe-use material. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with this. If you\u2019re giving repeat presentations, feel free to dip into past talks and pull out points. I lean towards illustrated slides instead of bullet points these days, so I\u2019ve even built up an illustration library which I\u2019ll happily re-use for new talks, even if the subject matter changes.\nOf course SXSW is more oriented toward 15 or 20 minutes of talking, so the time frame is a bit different. But chances are sooner or later you\u2019ll need to talk for an hour or so. Hopefully you\u2019ll be a natural, but if not, maybe these tips will help.",

      "text": "Over the past few years, I\u2019ve been invited to come speak at various events. No big surprise there, as I\u2019ve probably met a bunch of you at them. Since there\u2019s a chance that some are publicly speaking for the first time in Austin this year, I figured I\u2019d share a few things I\u2019ve tried along the way.\nThese tips will probably be more relevant if you\u2019re a nervous talker and you suspect you won\u2019t fill in enough time. (If you\u2019re a rambler, there are other people who can offer you far better advice than I.) It\u2019s timely in a way, because I think I\u2019ve finally crossed a threshold in my own speaking. I started off early 2004 in a bit of a fluster, went into overdrive preparation mode during most of 2005, and now in 2006, I think I\u2019m easing into speaking naturally and comfortably. Finally.\nWhen I first started, I wasn\u2019t sure how to plan for time constraints. Speaking for an hour seemed like a long time to keep going, and there was always a good chance I\u2019d miss important points along the way and end really early.\nSo I approached my preparation as if I were writing an article, which would take approximately an hour to read out loud. I\u2019d hole up in a cafe and breeze through a logical progression of thoughts that ended up being 10 pages or more of printed text, and try to separate that out into smaller bite-sized points for easier scanning when presenting. Then I\u2019d build slides based on that. It was a lot of work.\nNot only was I concerned about the time constraints though, I also got spooked out of allowing myself to ramble at all. I\u2019ve talked through three slides past the one that\u2019s currently on screen, only to madly catch up later. I\u2019ve realized halfway through that I didn\u2019t make a bunch of important points earlier to help support the current slide, so it in turn makes no sense without that context. I\u2019ve even gotten completely stuck from time to time, I think the most notable was on stage at WE04. \u201cUh, I completely forgot where I was going with that\u2026\u201d So to help myself avoid any repeats, I\u2019ve been meticulous in my preparation and made sure to have the entire presentation outlined, with a paper backup on hand, to ensure I could talk my way out of any glitches.\nBut that spiraled out of control, since every time I presented I tried to deliver new material, adapted to the theme of the conference. And thus, new supporting material. Not such a hot idea, I found out, as it\u2019s probably more important to be familiar with your material and comfortable when delivering it, than to be fresh all the time. Not to mention the extra time and effort creating a new set of slides every single time.\nSo recently, I\u2019ve realized a few things that I think are making me a better speaker. I\u2019ve stopped spending ages coming up with finely-detailed outlines of each presentation, and instead I\u2019m leaving more to real-time interaction. I\u2019m still no Veen or Molly, and likely will never be, but at least I\u2019m comfortable in my own methods now, and I think that\u2019s the real key to presenting well.\nKnow your material. But plan to make mistakes anyway. If you talk through a bunch of slides, oh well. Make them available later, and it\u2019s no big deal. If you have to back up and provide extra context that you missed earlier, go right ahead. You can even tell people that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing, although you probably don\u2019t need to. Also, if you\u2019re more of a bullet-point presenter, you can even use your slides as notes to keep you focused throughout. That\u2019s hardly a bad system, though we all know why PowerPoint is evil\u2026\nNervousness goes away. Five minutes into it, you\u2019ll stop being nervous and start having a bit more fun. And after doing a few presentations, you\u2019ll stop getting those butterflies in your stomach before hand, and feel a lot more at home on a stage.\nPause. Get used to taking small pauses here and there, to take a sip of water, to collect your thoughts, to slow yourself down, or whatever else. It\u2019s okay to have a few seconds of silence.\nHave a water bottle with you on stage. You\u2019ll need it for the dry mouth. Some lip balm might not be a bad idea either, if you\u2019re talking more than once.\nIf you get stuck on-stage, it\u2019s not a bad thing. You simply move on to the next topic. The audience might notice, or they might not. A lot of the things you\u2019re thinking internally during that moment will never get picked up by anyone else, so if what you\u2019re saying still makes some form of sense, chances are no one will catch it. (And if it doesn\u2019t make sense, often that\u2019s just glossed over! Not everyone is 100% coherent all the time when speaking, and it rarely matters.)\nBe prepared to allow for spontaneity. You can\u2019t really plan for the asides and diversions that you might make while on stage, but allow them to happen when they do. Often you\u2019ll explore a related idea that ties in with your main points nicely, and it\u2019ll work its way into future presentations. Try to keep yourself always coming back to the topic at hand, or at the very least, make sure to highlight why your diversion is relevant to the discussion. Don\u2019t spend too long on them, however.\nHave a lot of slides. If you\u2019re worried about time, just make sure you\u2019ve got more material than you need. Chances are you won\u2019t get through it all, but that\u2019s not a terrible problem to have. I\u2019d say 40 to 50 slides is probably enough to fill up an entire hour, as that\u2019s just over a minute each. As you get more comfortable, you can start bringing that number down.\nBe prepared, but it\u2019s not worth killing yourself. Don\u2019t go for broke on the slides, go for broke on familiarizing yourself with your topic and your slides. Do three dry runs before you get up on stage. Time yourself, and don\u2019t try to back up and re-try anything during the dry runs. Learn how to talk your way out of a factual error you just caught, speaking flub, or even just simple mispronunciation. Pretend there\u2019s an audience right in front of you and you only have that hour. This will quickly highlight the problem points, and often it\u2019ll cause you to re-arrange your slides.\nIf you don\u2019t fill the entire hour, no big deal. (If you\u2019re only hitting the 30 minute mark, you might need to have more material next time.) Q&A can usually fill up the rest of your time slot, and ever since I\u2019ve started speaking I\u2019ve had more fun answering questions than talking during the actual presentation. Try to make your talk amenable to follow-up questions, and if you\u2019ve got a small enough room (anything over 50 people is pushing it) you can even encourage questions throughout.\nMake sure you\u2019ve got a strong start, and the rest will fall into place. The first few minutes are the most important. The audience doesn\u2019t know what you\u2019re like, you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re like, so you need to get people interested. Plus, the sea of quiet faces is a bit overwhelming, so if you need to script any part of your presentation, this is the best part to script. After you\u2019ve gone through the introduction and started getting into the meat of it, people are likely to be more receptive and you won\u2019t feel so on the spot.\nRe-use material. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with this. If you\u2019re giving repeat presentations, feel free to dip into past talks and pull out points. I lean towards illustrated slides instead of bullet points these days, so I\u2019ve even built up an illustration library which I\u2019ll happily re-use for new talks, even if the subject matter changes.\nOf course SXSW is more oriented toward 15 or 20 minutes of talking, so the time frame is a bit different. But chances are sooner or later you\u2019ll need to talk for an hour or so. Hopefully you\u2019ll be a natural, but if not, maybe these tips will help.",
