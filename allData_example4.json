      "text": "The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It's to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself.\nThe very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common: they're something the founders themselves want, that they themselves can build, and that few others realize are worth doing. Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all began this way.\nWhy is it so important to work on a problem you have? Among other things, it ensures the problem really exists. It sounds obvious to say you should only work on problems that exist. And yet by far the most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one has.\nI made it myself. In 1995 I started a company to put art galleries online. But galleries didn't want to be online. It's not how the art business works. So why did I spend 6 months working on this stupid idea? Because I didn't pay attention to users. I invented a model of the world that didn't correspond to reality, and worked from that. I didn't notice my model was wrong until I tried to convince users to pay for what we'd built. Even then I took embarrassingly long to catch on. I was attached to my model of the world, and I'd spent a lot of time on the software. They had to want it!\nWhy do so many founders build things no one wants? Because they begin by trying to think of startup ideas. That m.o. is doubly dangerous: it doesn't merely yield few good ideas; it yields bad ideas that sound plausible enough to fool you into working on them.\nAt YC we call these \"made-up\" or \"sitcom\" startup ideas. Imagine one of the characters on a TV show was starting a startup. The writers would have to invent something for it to do. But coming up with good startup ideas is hard. It's not something you can do for the asking. So (unless they got amazingly lucky) the writers would come up with an idea that sounded plausible, but was actually bad.\nFor example, a social network for pet owners. It doesn't sound obviously mistaken. Millions of people have pets. Often they care a lot about their pets and spend a lot of money on them. Surely many of these people would like a site where they could talk to other pet owners. Not all of them perhaps, but if just 2 or 3 percent were regular visitors, you could have millions of users. You could serve them targeted offers, and maybe charge for premium features. [1]\nThe danger of an idea like this is that when you run it by your friends with pets, they don't say \"I would never use this.\" They say \"Yeah, maybe I could see using something like that.\" Even when the startup launches, it will sound plausible to a lot of people. They don't want to use it themselves, at least not right now, but they could imagine other people wanting it. Sum that reaction across the entire population, and you have zero users. [2]\nWhen a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who really need what they're making\u2014not just people who could see themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently. Usually this initial group of users is small, for the simple reason that if there were something that large numbers of people urgently needed and that could be built with the amount of effort a startup usually puts into a version one, it would probably already exist. Which means you have to compromise on one dimension: you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type.\nImagine a graph whose x axis represents all the people who might want what you're making and whose y axis represents how much they want it. If you invert the scale on the y axis, you can envision companies as holes. Google is an immense crater: hundreds of millions of people use it, and they need it a lot. A startup just starting out can't expect to excavate that much volume. So you have two choices about the shape of hole you start with. You can either dig a hole that's broad but shallow, or one that's narrow and deep, like a well.\nMade-up startup ideas are usually of the first type. Lots of people are mildly interested in a social network for pet owners.\nNearly all good startup ideas are of the second type. Microsoft was a well when they made Altair Basic. There were only a couple thousand Altair owners, but without this software they were programming in machine language. Thirty years later Facebook had the same shape. Their first site was exclusively for Harvard students, of which there are only a few thousand, but those few thousand users wanted it a lot.\nWhen you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this right now? Who wants this so much that they'll use it even when it's a crappy version one made by a two-person startup they've never heard of? If you can't answer that, the idea is probably bad. [3]\nYou don't need the narrowness of the well per se. It's depth you need; you get narrowness as a byproduct of optimizing for depth (and speed). But you almost always do get it. In practice the link between depth and narrowness is so strong that it's a good sign when you know that an idea will appeal strongly to a specific group or type of user.\nBut while demand shaped like a well is almost a necessary condition for a good startup idea, it's not a sufficient one. If Mark Zuckerberg had built something that could only ever have appealed to Harvard students, it would not have been a good startup idea. Facebook was a good idea because it started with a small market there was a fast path out of. Colleges are similar enough that if you build a facebook that works at Harvard, it will work at any college. So you spread rapidly through all the colleges. Once you have all the college students, you get everyone else simply by letting them in.\nSimilarly for Microsoft: Basic for the Altair; Basic for other machines; other languages besides Basic; operating systems; applications; IPO.\nHow do you tell whether there's a path out of an idea? How do you tell whether something is the germ of a giant company, or just a niche product? Often you can't. The founders of Airbnb didn't realize at first how big a market they were tapping. Initially they had a much narrower idea. They were going to let hosts rent out space on their floors during conventions. They didn't foresee the expansion of this idea; it forced itself upon them gradually. All they knew at first is that they were onto something. That's probably as much as Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg knew at first.\nOccasionally it's obvious from the beginning when there's a path out of the initial niche. And sometimes I can see a path that's not immediately obvious; that's one of our specialties at YC. But there are limits to how well this can be done, no matter how much experience you have. The most important thing to understand about paths out of the initial idea is the meta-fact that these are hard to see.\nSo if you can't predict whether there's a path out of an idea, how do you choose between ideas? The truth is disappointing but interesting: if you're the right sort of person, you have the right sort of hunches. If you're at the leading edge of a field that's changing fast, when you have a hunch that something is worth doing, you're more likely to be right. I've wondered about that passage since I read it in high school. I'm not sure how useful his advice is for painting specifically, but it fits this situation well. Empirically, the way to have good startup ideas is to become the sort of person who has them.\nBeing at the leading edge of a field doesn't mean you have to be one of the people pushing it forward. You can also be at the leading edge as a user. It was not so much because he was a programmer that Facebook seemed a good idea to Mark Zuckerberg as because he used computers so much. If you'd asked most 40 year olds in 2004 whether they'd like to publish their lives semi-publicly on the Internet, they'd have been horrified at the idea. But Mark already lived online; to him it seemed natural.\nPaul Buchheit says that people at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field \"live in the future.\" Combine that with Pirsig and you get:\n Live in the future, then build what's missing.  That describes the way many if not most of the biggest startups got started. Neither Apple nor Yahoo nor Google nor Facebook were even supposed to be companies at first. They grew out of things their founders built because there seemed a gap in the world.\nIf you look at the way successful founders have had their ideas, it's generally the result of some external stimulus hitting a prepared mind. Bill Gates and Paul Allen hear about the Altair and think \"I bet we could write a Basic interpreter for it.\" Drew Houston realizes he's forgotten his USB stick and thinks \"I really need to make my files live online.\" Lots of people heard about the Altair. Lots forgot USB sticks. The reason those stimuli caused those founders to start companies was that their experiences had prepared them to notice the opportunities they represented.\nThe verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not \"think up\" but \"notice.\" At YC we call ideas that grow naturally out of the founders' own experiences \"organic\" startup ideas. The most successful startups almost all begin this way.\nThat may not have been what you wanted to hear. You may have expected recipes for coming up with startup ideas, and instead I'm telling you that the key is to have a mind that's prepared in the right way. But disappointing though it may be, this is the truth. And it is a recipe of a sort, just one that in the worst case takes a year rather than a weekend.\nIf you're not at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field, you can get to one. For example, anyone reasonably smart can probably get to an edge of programming (e.g. building mobile apps) in a year. Since a successful startup will consume at least 3-5 years of your life, a year's preparation would be a reasonable investment. Especially if you're also looking for a cofounder. [4]\nYou don't have to learn programming to be at the leading edge of a domain that's changing fast. Other domains change fast. But while learning to hack is not necessary, it is for the forseeable future sufficient. As Marc Andreessen put it, software is eating the world, and this trend has decades left to run.\nKnowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you'll be able to implement them. That's not absolutely necessary (Jeff Bezos couldn't) but it's an advantage. It's a big advantage, when you're considering an idea like putting a college facebook online, if instead of merely thinking \"That's an interesting idea,\" you can think instead \"That's an interesting idea. I'll try building an initial version tonight.\" It's even better when you're both a programmer and the target user, because then the cycle of generating new versions and testing them on users can happen inside one head.\n Noticing\nOnce you're living in the future in some respect, the way to notice startup ideas is to look for things that seem to be missing. If you're really at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field, there will be things that are obviously missing. What won't be obvious is that they're startup ideas. So if you want to find startup ideas, don't merely turn on the filter \"What's missing?\" Also turn off every other filter, particularly \"Could this be a big company?\" There's plenty of time to apply that test later. But if you're thinking about that initially, it may not only filter out lots of good ideas, but also cause you to focus on bad ones.\nMost things that are missing will take some time to see. You almost have to trick yourself into seeing the ideas around you.\nBut you know the ideas are out there. This is not one of those problems where there might not be an answer. It's impossibly unlikely that this is the exact moment when technological progress stops. You can be sure people are going to build things in the next few years that will make you think \"What did I do before x?\"\nAnd when these problems get solved, they will probably seem flamingly obvious in retrospect. What you need to do is turn off the filters that usually prevent you from seeing them. The most powerful is simply taking the current state of the world for granted. Even the most radically open-minded of us mostly do that. You couldn't get from your bed to the front door if you stopped to question everything.\nBut if you're looking for startup ideas you can sacrifice some of the efficiency of taking the status quo for granted and start to question things. Why is your inbox overflowing? Because you get a lot of email, or because it's hard to get email out of your inbox? Why do you get so much email? What problems are people trying to solve by sending you email? Are there better ways to solve them? And why is it hard to get emails out of your inbox? Why do you keep emails around after you've read them? Is an inbox the optimal tool for that?\nPay particular attention to things that chafe you. The advantage of taking the status quo for granted is not just that it makes life (locally) more efficient, but also that it makes life more tolerable. If you knew about all the things we'll get in the next 50 years but don't have yet, you'd find present day life pretty constraining, just as someone from the present would if they were sent back 50 years in a time machine. When something annoys you, it could be because you're living in the future.\nWhen you find the right sort of problem, you should probably be able to describe it as obvious, at least to you. When we started Viaweb, all the online stores were built by hand, by web designers making individual HTML pages. It was obvious to us as programmers that these sites would have to be generated by software. [5]\nWhich means, strangely enough, that coming up with startup ideas is a question of seeing the obvious. That suggests how weird this process is: you're trying to see things that are obvious, and yet that you hadn't seen.\nSince what you need to do here is loosen up your own mind, it may be best not to make too much of a direct frontal attack on the problem\u2014i.e. to sit down and try to think of ideas. The best plan may be just to keep a background process running, looking for things that seem to be missing. Work on hard problems, driven mainly by curiousity, but have a second self watching over your shoulder, taking note of gaps and anomalies. [6]\nGive yourself some time. You have a lot of control over the rate at which you turn yours into a prepared mind, but you have less control over the stimuli that spark ideas when they hit it. If Bill Gates and Paul Allen had constrained themselves to come up with a startup idea in one month, what if they'd chosen a month before the Altair appeared? They probably would have worked on a less promising idea. Drew Houston did work on a less promising idea before Dropbox: an SAT prep startup. But Dropbox was a much better idea, both in the absolute sense and also as a match for his skills. [7]\nA good way to trick yourself into noticing ideas is to work on projects that seem like they'd be cool. If you do that, you'll naturally tend to build things that are missing. It wouldn't seem as interesting to build something that already existed.\nJust as trying to think up startup ideas tends to produce bad ones, working on things that could be dismissed as \"toys\" often produces good ones. When something is described as a toy, that means it has everything an idea needs except being important. It's cool; users love it; it just doesn't matter. But if you're living in the future and you build something cool that users love, it may matter more than outsiders think. Microcomputers seemed like toys when Apple and Microsoft started working on them. I'm old enough to remember that era; the usual term for people with their own microcomputers was \"hobbyists.\" BackRub seemed like an inconsequential science project. The Facebook was just a way for undergrads to stalk one another.\nAt YC we're excited when we meet startups working on things that we could imagine know-it-alls on forums dismissing as toys. To us that's positive evidence an idea is good.\nIf you can afford to take a long view (and arguably you can't afford not to), you can turn \"Live in the future and build what's missing\" into something even better:\n Live in the future and build what seems interesting.\n School\nThat's what I'd advise college students to do, rather than trying to learn about \"entrepreneurship.\" \"Entrepreneurship\" is something you learn best by doing it. The examples of the most successful founders make that clear. What you should be spending your time on in college is ratcheting yourself into the future. College is an incomparable opportunity to do that. What a waste to sacrifice an opportunity to solve the hard part of starting a startup\u2014becoming the sort of person who can have organic startup ideas\u2014by spending time learning about the easy part. Especially since you won't even really learn about it, any more than you'd learn about sex in a class. All you'll learn is the words for things.\nThe clash of domains is a particularly fruitful source of ideas. If you know a lot about programming and you start learning about some other field, you'll probably see problems that software could solve. In fact, you're doubly likely to find good problems in another domain: (a) the inhabitants of that domain are not as likely as software people to have already solved their problems with software, and (b) since you come into the new domain totally ignorant, you don't even know what the status quo is to take it for granted.\nSo if you're a CS major and you want to start a startup, instead of taking a class on entrepreneurship you're better off taking a class on, say, genetics. Or better still, go work for a biotech company. CS majors normally get summer jobs at computer hardware or software companies. But if you want to find startup ideas, you might do better to get a summer job in some unrelated field. [8]\nOr don't take any extra classes, and just build things. It's no coincidence that Microsoft and Facebook both got started in January. At Harvard that is (or was) Reading Period, when students have no classes to attend because they're supposed to be studying for finals. [9]\nBut don't feel like you have to build things that will become startups. That's premature optimization. Just build things. Preferably with other students. It's not just the classes that make a university such a good place to crank oneself into the future. You're also surrounded by other people trying to do the same thing. If you work together with them on projects, you'll end up producing not just organic ideas, but organic ideas with organic founding teams\u2014and that, empirically, is the best combination.\nBeware of research. If an undergrad writes something all his friends start using, it's quite likely to represent a good startup idea. Whereas a PhD dissertation is extremely unlikely to. For some reason, the more a project has to count as research, the less likely it is to be something that could be turned into a startup. [10] I think the reason is that the subset of ideas that count as research is so narrow that it's unlikely that a project that satisfied that constraint would also satisfy the orthogonal constraint of solving users' problems. Whereas when students (or professors) build something as a side-project, they automatically gravitate toward solving users' problems\u2014perhaps even with an additional energy that comes from being freed from the constraints of research.\n Competition\nBecause a good idea should seem obvious, when you have one you'll tend to feel that you're late. Don't let that deter you. Worrying that you're late is one of the signs of a good idea. Ten minutes of searching the web will usually settle the question. Even if you find someone else working on the same thing, you're probably not too late. It's exceptionally rare for startups to be killed by competitors\u2014so rare that you can almost discount the possibility. So unless you discover a competitor with the sort of lock-in that would prevent users from choosing you, don't discard the idea.\nIf you're uncertain, ask users. The question of whether you're too late is subsumed by the question of whether anyone urgently needs what you plan to make. If you have something that no competitor does and that some subset of users urgently need, you have a beachhead. [11]\nThe question then is whether that beachhead is big enough. Or more importantly, who's in it: if the beachhead consists of people doing something lots more people will be doing in the future, then it's probably big enough no matter how small it is. For example, if you're building something differentiated from competitors by the fact that it works on phones, but it only works on the newest phones, that's probably a big enough beachhead.\nErr on the side of doing things where you'll face competitors. Inexperienced founders usually give competitors more credit than they deserve. Whether you succeed depends far more on you than on your competitors. So better a good idea with competitors than a bad one without.\nYou don't need to worry about entering a \"crowded market\" so long as you have a thesis about what everyone else in it is overlooking. In fact that's a very promising starting point. Google was that type of idea. Your thesis has to be more precise than \"we're going to make an x that doesn't suck\" though. You have to be able to phrase it in terms of something the incumbents are overlooking. Best of all is when you can say that they didn't have the courage of their convictions, and that your plan is what they'd have done if they'd followed through on their own insights. Google was that type of idea too. The search engines that preceded them shied away from the most radical implications of what they were doing\u2014particularly that the better a job they did, the faster users would leave.\nA crowded market is actually a good sign, because it means both that there's demand and that none of the existing solutions are good enough. A startup can't hope to enter a market that's obviously big and yet in which they have no competitors. So any startup that succeeds is either going to be entering a market with existing competitors, but armed with some secret weapon that will get them all the users (like Google), or entering a market that looks small but which will turn out to be big (like Microsoft). [12]\n Filters\nThere are two more filters you'll need to turn off if you want to notice startup ideas: the unsexy filter and the schlep filter.\nMost programmers wish they could start a startup by just writing some brilliant code, pushing it to a server, and having users pay them lots of money. They'd prefer not to deal with tedious problems or get involved in messy ways with the real world. Which is a reasonable preference, because such things slow you down. But this preference is so widespread that the space of convenient startup ideas has been stripped pretty clean. If you let your mind wander a few blocks down the street to the messy, tedious ideas, you'll find valuable ones just sitting there waiting to be implemented.\nThe schlep filter is so dangerous that I wrote a separate essay about the condition it induces, which I called schlep blindness. I gave Stripe as an example of a startup that benefited from turning off this filter, and a pretty striking example it is. Thousands of programmers were in a position to see this idea; thousands of programmers knew how painful it was to process payments before Stripe. But when they looked for startup ideas they didn't see this one, because unconsciously they shrank from having to deal with payments. And dealing with payments is a schlep for Stripe, but not an intolerable one. In fact they might have had net less pain; because the fear of dealing with payments kept most people away from this idea, Stripe has had comparatively smooth sailing in other areas that are sometimes painful, like user acquisition. They didn't have to try very hard to make themselves heard by users, because users were desperately waiting for what they were building.\nThe unsexy filter is similar to the schlep filter, except it keeps you from working on problems you despise rather than ones you fear. We overcame this one to work on Viaweb. There were interesting things about the architecture of our software, but we weren't interested in ecommerce per se. We could see the problem was one that needed to be solved though.\nTurning off the schlep filter is more important than turning off the unsexy filter, because the schlep filter is more likely to be an illusion. And even to the degree it isn't, it's a worse form of self-indulgence. Starting a successful startup is going to be fairly laborious no matter what. Even if the product doesn't entail a lot of schleps, you'll still have plenty dealing with investors, hiring and firing people, and so on. So if there's some idea you think would be cool but you're kept away from by fear of the schleps involved, don't worry: any sufficiently good idea will have as many.\nThe unsexy filter, while still a source of error, is not as entirely useless as the schlep filter. If you're at the leading edge of a field that's changing rapidly, your ideas about what's sexy will be somewhat correlated with what's valuable in practice. Particularly as you get older and more experienced. Plus if you find an idea sexy, you'll work on it more enthusiastically. [13]\n Recipes\nWhile the best way to discover startup ideas is to become the sort of person who has them and then build whatever interests you, sometimes you don't have that luxury. Sometimes you need an idea now. For example, if you're working on a startup and your initial idea turns out to be bad.\nFor the rest of this essay I'll talk about tricks for coming up with startup ideas on demand. Although empirically you're better off using the organic strategy, you could succeed this way. You just have to be more disciplined. When you use the organic method, you don't even notice an idea unless it's evidence that something is truly missing. But when you make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, you have to replace this natural constraint with self-discipline. You'll see a lot more ideas, most of them bad, so you need to be able to filter them.\nOne of the biggest dangers of not using the organic method is the example of the organic method. Organic ideas feel like inspirations. There are a lot of stories about successful startups that began when the founders had what seemed a crazy idea but \"just knew\" it was promising. When you feel that about an idea you've had while trying to come up with startup ideas, you're probably mistaken.\nWhen searching for ideas, look in areas where you have some expertise. If you're a database expert, don't build a chat app for teenagers (unless you're also a teenager). Maybe it's a good idea, but you can't trust your judgment about that, so ignore it. There have to be other ideas that involve databases, and whose quality you can judge. Do you find it hard to come up with good ideas involving databases? That's because your expertise raises your standards. Your ideas about chat apps are just as bad, but you're giving yourself a Dunning-Kruger pass in that domain.\nThe place to start looking for ideas is things you need. There must be things you need. [14]\nOne good trick is to ask yourself whether in your previous job you ever found yourself saying \"Why doesn't someone make x? If someone made x we'd buy it in a second.\" If you can think of any x people said that about, you probably have an idea. You know there's demand, and people don't say that about things that are impossible to build.\nMore generally, try asking yourself whether there's something unusual about you that makes your needs different from most other people's. You're probably not the only one. It's especially good if you're different in a way people will increasingly be.\nIf you're changing ideas, one unusual thing about you is the idea you'd previously been working on. Did you discover any needs while working on it? Several well-known startups began this way. Hotmail began as something its founders wrote to talk about their previous startup idea while they were working at their day jobs. [15]\nA particularly promising way to be unusual is to be young. Some of the most valuable new ideas take root first among people in their teens and early twenties. And while young founders are at a disadvantage in some respects, they're the only ones who really understand their peers. It would have been very hard for someone who wasn't a college student to start Facebook. So if you're a young founder (under 23 say), are there things you and your friends would like to do that current technology won't let you?\nThe next best thing to an unmet need of your own is an unmet need of someone else. Try talking to everyone you can about the gaps they find in the world. What's missing? What would they like to do that they can't? What's tedious or annoying, particularly in their work? Let the conversation get general; don't be trying too hard to find startup ideas. You're just looking for something to spark a thought. Maybe you'll notice a problem they didn't consciously realize they had, because you know how to solve it.\nWhen you find an unmet need that isn't your own, it may be somewhat blurry at first. The person who needs something may not know exactly what they need. In that case I often recommend that founders act like consultants\u2014that they do what they'd do if they'd been retained to solve the problems of this one user. People's problems are similar enough that nearly all the code you write this way will be reusable, and whatever isn't will be a small price to start out certain that you've reached the bottom of the well. [16]\nOne way to ensure you do a good job solving other people's problems is to make them your own. When Rajat Suri of E la Carte decided to write software for restaurants, he got a job as a waiter to learn how restaurants worked. That may seem like taking things to extremes, but startups are extreme. We love it when founders do such things.\nIn fact, one strategy I recommend to people who need a new idea is not merely to turn off their schlep and unsexy filters, but to seek out ideas that are unsexy or involve schleps. Don't try to start Twitter. Those ideas are so rare that you can't find them by looking for them. Make something unsexy that people will pay you for.\nA good trick for bypassing the schlep and to some extent the unsexy filter is to ask what you wish someone else would build, so that you could use it. What would you pay for right now?\nSince startups often garbage-collect broken companies and industries, it can be a good trick to look for those that are dying, or deserve to, and try to imagine what kind of company would profit from their demise. For example, journalism is in free fall at the moment. But there may still be money to be made from something like journalism. What sort of company might cause people in the future to say \"this replaced journalism\" on some axis?\nBut imagine asking that in the future, not now. When one company or industry replaces another, it usually comes in from the side. So don't look for a replacement for x; look for something that people will later say turned out to be a replacement for x. And be imaginative about the axis along which the replacement occurs. Traditional journalism, for example, is a way for readers to get information and to kill time, a way for writers to make money and to get attention, and a vehicle for several different types of advertising. It could be replaced on any of these axes (it has already started to be on most).\nWhen startups consume incumbents, they usually start by serving some small but important market that the big players ignore. It's particularly good if there's an admixture of disdain in the big players' attitude, because that often misleads them. For example, after Steve Wozniak built the computer that became the Apple I, he felt obliged to give his then-employer Hewlett-Packard the option to produce it. Fortunately for him, they turned it down, and one of the reasons they did was that it used a TV for a monitor, which seemed intolerably d\u00e9class\u00e9 to a high-end hardware company like HP was at the time. [17]\nAre there groups of scruffy but sophisticated users like the early microcomputer \"hobbyists\" that are currently being ignored by the big players? A startup with its sights set on bigger things can often capture a small market easily by expending an effort that wouldn't be justified by that market alone.\nSimilarly, since the most successful startups generally ride some wave bigger than themselves, it could be a good trick to look for waves and ask how one could benefit from them. The prices of gene sequencing and 3D printing are both experiencing Moore's Law-like declines. What new things will we be able to do in the new world we'll have in a few years? What are we unconsciously ruling out as impossible that will soon be possible?\n Organic\nBut talking about looking explicitly for waves makes it clear that such recipes are plan B for getting startup ideas. Looking for waves is essentially a way to simulate the organic method. If you're at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field, you don't have to look for waves; you are the wave.\nFinding startup ideas is a subtle business, and that's why most people who try fail so miserably. It doesn't work well simply to try to think of startup ideas. If you do that, you get bad ones that sound dangerously plausible. The best approach is more indirect: if you have the right sort of background, good startup ideas will seem obvious to you. But even then, not immediately. It takes time to come across situations where you notice something missing. And often these gaps won't seem to be ideas for companies, just things that would be interesting to build. Which is why it's good to have the time and the inclination to build things just because they're interesting.\nLive in the future and build what seems interesting. Strange as it sounds, that's the real recipe.\n Notes\n[1] This form of bad idea has been around as long as the web. It was common in the 1990s, except then people who had it used to say they were going to create a portal for x instead of a social network for x. Structurally the idea is stone soup: you post a sign saying \"this is the place for people interested in x,\" and all those people show up and you make money from them. What lures founders into this sort of idea are statistics about the millions of people who might be interested in each type of x. What they forget is that any given person might have 20 affinities by this standard, and no one is going to visit 20 different communities regularly.\n[2] I'm not saying, incidentally, that I know for sure a social network for pet owners is a bad idea. I know it's a bad idea the way I know randomly generated DNA would not produce a viable organism. The set of plausible sounding startup ideas is many times larger than the set of good ones, and many of the good ones don't even sound that plausible. So if all you know about a startup idea is that it sounds plausible, you have to assume it's bad.\n[3] More precisely, the users' need has to give them sufficient activation energy to start using whatever you make, which can vary a lot. For example, the activation energy for enterprise software sold through traditional channels is very high, so you'd have to be a lot better to get users to switch. Whereas the activation energy required to switch to a new search engine is low. Which in turn is why search engines are so much better than enterprise software.\n[4] This gets harder as you get older. While the space of ideas doesn't have dangerous local maxima, the space of careers does. There are fairly high walls between most of the paths people take through life, and the older you get, the higher the walls become.\n[5] It was also obvious to us that the web was going to be a big deal. Few non-programmers grasped that in 1995, but the programmers had seen what GUIs had done for desktop computers.\n[6] Maybe it would work to have this second self keep a journal, and each night to make a brief entry listing the gaps and anomalies you'd noticed that day. Not startup ideas, just the raw gaps and anomalies.\n[7] Sam Altman points out that taking time to come up with an idea is not merely a better strategy in an absolute sense, but also like an undervalued stock in that so few founders do it.\nThere's comparatively little competition for the best ideas, because few founders are willing to put in the time required to notice them. Whereas there is a great deal of competition for mediocre ideas, because when people make up startup ideas, they tend to make up the same ones.\n[8] For the computer hardware and software companies, summer jobs are the first phase of the recruiting funnel. But if you're good you can skip the first phase. If you're good you'll have no trouble getting hired by these companies when you graduate, regardless of how you spent your summers.\n[9] The empirical evidence suggests that if colleges want to help their students start startups, the best thing they can do is leave them alone in the right way.\n[10] I'm speaking here of IT startups; in biotech things are different.\n[11] This is an instance of a more general rule: focus on users, not competitors. The most important information about competitors is what you learn via users anyway.\n[12] In practice most successful startups have elements of both. And you can describe each strategy in terms of the other by adjusting the boundaries of what you call the market. But it's useful to consider these two ideas separately.\n[13] I almost hesitate to raise that point though. Startups are businesses; the point of a business is to make money; and with that additional constraint, you can't expect you'll be able to spend all your time working on what interests you most.\n[14] The need has to be a strong one. You can retroactively describe any made-up idea as something you need. But do you really need that recipe site or local event aggregator as much as Drew Houston needed Dropbox, or Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia needed Airbnb?\nQuite often at YC I find myself asking founders \"Would you use this thing yourself, if you hadn't written it?\" and you'd be surprised how often the answer is no.\n[15] Paul Buchheit points out that trying to sell something bad can be a source of better ideas:\n\"The best technique I've found for dealing with YC companies that have bad ideas is to tell them to go sell the product ASAP (before wasting time building it). Not only do they learn that nobody wants what they are building, they very often come back with a real idea that they discovered in the process of trying to sell the bad idea.\"\n[16] Here's a recipe that might produce the next Facebook, if you're college students. If you have a connection to one of the more powerful sororities at your school, approach the queen bees thereof and offer to be their personal IT consultants, building anything they could imagine needing in their social lives that didn't already exist. Anything that got built this way would be very promising, because such users are not just the most demanding but also the perfect point to spread from.\nI have no idea whether this would work.\n[17] And the reason it used a TV for a monitor is that Steve Wozniak started out by solving his own problems. He, like most of his peers, couldn't afford a monitor.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Mike Arrington, Paul Buchheit, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Garry Tan, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this, and Marc Andreessen, Joe Gebbia, Reid Hoffman, Shel Kaphan, Mike Moritz and Kevin Systrom for answering my questions about startup history.",

      "text": "Photo by Scott M. Lacey\nLast November, with great fanfare, Harvard celebrated the opening of its sparkling new $20 million Innovation Lab. A soaring 30,000 square-foot testament to contemporary architecture built right into the heart of the Harvard Business School, the I-Lab represents something profoundly new for the university: a full-throttle effort to transform itself into a leader in the increasingly important world of tech entrepreneurship. The goal, both simple and ambitious, is to bring together the world\u2019s best and brightest young entrepreneurs, to nurture them in a stimulating and collaborative environment, and to help them transform their ideas into real-world businesses. \u201cGathering great minds under a single roof\u201d is how Harvard\u2019s president, Drew Gilpin Faust, described the mission of the I-Lab at the opening ceremony, \u201cso that they can become great together.\u201d\nTech entrepreneurship is the new sexy. It\u2019s what legions of promising teens and twentysomethings are crazy for today, and Harvard wants in on the action. Sure, the university can claim two of the great tech entrepreneurs of the age, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, as its own. But they had to drop out of Harvard in order to transform their world-changing ideas into reality. \u201cZuckerberg did Facebook over our dead body,\u201d says Joe Lassiter, the faculty chair of the I-Lab. \u201cThe commitment to [entrepreneurship] at this level, and across the university, is quite a new thought.\u201d\nTrue to form, Harvard has been touting the creation of the I-Lab as a revolutionary development, as a stop-the-presses, here-we-come moment of change not just for the university but also the world of higher education. But the thing is, it\u2019s not. Harvard is actually nearly a quarter-century late to the world of tech entrepreneurship, and as it scrambles to get into the game, it\u2019s finding itself in an uncomfortable position, not leading the charge, as it would like to, but desperately playing catch-up to its crosstown rival, MIT.\nIn many ways, the I-Lab is actually a derivative enterprise, clearly based on the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship, which since 1990 has been nurturing tech entrepreneurs and churning out an astonishing number of startups. \u201cYou can see that Harvard copied MIT,\u201d Bill Aulet, the managing director of the Trust Center, and himself a Harvard alum, told me recently. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing entrepreneurship for a long time, and now Harvard is finally coming over to our way. But MIT has never been better. This is our time.\u201d\nIndeed it is. Everybody\u2019s suddenly sweet on MIT. This past July, speaking in Boston at the Global Business Travel Association, Bill Clinton described the university as having the \u201cbest technology-transfer program in the country,\u201d tops at turning student ideas into blockbuster businesses. It\u2019s hard to disagree. Between 2000 and 2006, MIT graduates started more than 5,800 companies, and the numbers have only been rising since. The Institute produces more patent applications than any other single university in the world, with 179 in 2011. MIT\u2019s entrepreneurial impact is so great that, according to a 2009 study conducted by the founder of the Trust Center, active companies created by its alumni bring in a combined revenue today of as much as $2 trillion. That would make those companies the equivalent of the 11th-largest economy in the world.\nThose in the rankings business are also falling over themselves to praise MIT. This past August, Forbes named the Institute the second-most-entrepreneurial college in the country, and that same month, after taking into account such factors as the potential earnings of graduates, Newsweek\u2019s the Daily Beast named it the nation\u2019s most affordable college. Then in September came the best moment of all. In its annual ranking of the world\u2019s great universities, QS, a London-based education-consulting-and-research firm, moved MIT above Harvard\u2014and named it the best in the world.\nAsh Martin certainly never wanted to go to Harvard. Why would he? In his view, Harvard spits out CEOs, bankers, lawyers, and moneymen. That\u2019s so 1990s. (Photo by Jesse Burke)\nMIT has long been the home of the nerd whose idea of fun is staying up late solving equations and writing code. But that\u2019s changing fast. Droves of energetic young rebels, risk takers, and mavericks are now arriving at the university, hoping to make it big as tech entrepreneurs, and they\u2019re transforming the spirit of the place. As improbable as it might seem, MIT has gone from geek to chic. \u201cI lecture all around at different schools, like Babson, Emerson, BU, BC, Harvard, and MIT,\u201d says Brian Patrick Halligan, a graduate of MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management and the CEO and founder of the successful Cambridge-based marketing-software business HubSpot. \u201cAnd MIT kids are by far the best. They\u2019re smart, articulate, covered in tattoos\u2014they\u2019re cool and hip and very different. Their clothes are edgy. And they\u2019re all starting companies.\u201d\nAsh Martin, in his second year at Sloan, is exactly the kind of student Halligan is talking about. A cofounder of Viztu Technologies, which creates software that allows anyone to take and print digital 3-D images, Martin is blonde and brawny, with chiseled movie-star looks\u2014and yes, he has tattoos. He plays water polo. He looks like a rock-star surfer, not someone who\u2019s been hunkered down for the past year in the technological trenches, making breakthroughs in 3-D technology.\nMartin is at the vanguard of change. Traditional careers in banking, medicine, and the law, which once promised lavish salaries and long-term sustainability, no longer provide a guaranteed route to success. The American Bar Association announced in June, for instance, that in 2011 only 55 percent of the nation\u2019s law school graduates had landed full-time jobs within nine months of graduation. Overall, there are fewer \u201cforever\u201d jobs. Thousands of talented young students who might previously have considered these traditional careers are now deciding to go it on their own as entrepreneurs\u2014and they\u2019re choosing colleges and universities accordingly.\nMartin shatters the geek stereotype, yet he feels right at home at MIT. \u201cIt\u2019s full of my people,\u201d he says, \u201cthe roll-up-your-sleeves-and-get-it-done people. This is where it\u2019s at, and where I want to be.\u201d Martin certainly never considered Harvard. Why would he? In his view, Harvard spits out CEOs, bankers, lawyers, and moneymen. That\u2019s so 1990s. Like so many others in his generation, he doesn\u2019t want to be just a businessman, or a tech geek who makes things work behind the scenes. He wants to be like Steve Jobs, an iconoclastic master of the universe, a tech wizard with culture-changing powers. He chose MIT specifically because, in the new global economy, it offered him the best chance to realize his dreams: to start a business and make a difference in the world, not to mention earn some serious cash. On all of those fronts, he\u2019s well on his way. A few months ago, he and his partner sold Viztu Technologies for an undisclosed sum to an international outfit called 3D Systems.\n\u201cTech entrepreneurship is becoming a profession akin to law or architecture,\u201d says Noubar Afeyan, the CEO of the Cambridge-based venture capital firm Flagship Ventures. \u201cAnd that\u2019s increasingly causing people to say, \u2018How do I prepare for this and arm myself to tip the odds in my favor?\u2019\u201d These days, for those lucky enough to get in, there\u2019s a simple answer to that question.\nGo to MIT.\nRomi Kadri, full-time MIT student and entrepreneurial jack of all trades. (Photo by Jesse Burke)\nThat\u2019s exactly what I did one afternoon this past August. Universities often feel deserted in the summer, but when I arrived at the Trust Center, the hub of MIT\u2019s entrepreneurial efforts, I found the place crackling with life.\nAn independent entity within MIT, the center offers students from all parts of the Institute a wealth of resources: expert mentors, office space, classes on entrepreneurship, and networking opportunities with not only other students and faculty but also outside businesspeople and venture capitalists. Certain specialized programs\u2014ones involving mentoring and grants, for example\u2014require students to apply and be accepted, but any MIT student interested in entrepreneurship can register for classes, meet with experts about an idea for a company, or join one of the 14 student clubs dedicated to creating businesses. The center began in 1990 by offering one class, taught by an adjunct professor, but today has more than 30 courses, taught by 35 faculty members from all over MIT, and offers an MBA track with Sloan in entrepreneurship and innovation. And student interest has skyrocketed. In 1996 only 288 students took entrepreneurship courses. Now approximately 1,500 sign up for them every year.\nFrom the outside, the center doesn\u2019t look like much. It\u2019s hidden inside a drab, unremarkable building on the MIT campus, known to all simply as E40. When you enter, though, you find yourself in a space that\u2019s cheery, modern, and bright. Most walls are covered in whiteboard paint for students to scribble on as they work, and those that aren\u2019t have been painted an intense shade of orange. At only 4,000 square feet, it\u2019s a small space, long and narrow, but MIT has made the most of it, packing in open-air cubicles, a few phone-booth-size offices, some bigger glass-walled workrooms, a video-conference room, and a kitchenette filled with cases of free energy drinks and ramen noodles.\nMost of the real work gets done in an open area at the rear of the suite. When I got there, I found clusters of students in T-shirts at a number of movable tables on wheels. In one corner, a small group was discussing the development of solar panels designed to power cell phones. Several desks away, two women were working out the kinks in a plan to create an iTunes-like marketplace for photographs and paintings. A group of guys near them was talking through the design of a super-slippery plastic container that would make even honey and ketchup slide easily out of bottles, a high-tech bid to capture part of the $33-billion-a-year condiment industry. The space was buzzing with activity, and as I wandered around it was easy to believe that somewhere in the room with me might be the next Jobs or Zuckerberg.\nSeveral days later, at a nearby coffee shop, I met Romi Kadri, a junior from Scotland. Tan, fit, and 21 years old, Kadri has a warm smile and the ceaseless energy of a Red Bull addict. He wrote his first business plan when he was nine. When he was 15, he introduced the owners of a mom-and-pop bicycle store in his hometown to the Internet and proceeded to transform their operation into an online powerhouse. Just another MIT geek, right? No. He grew up in Glasglow, where navigating the city\u2019s notorious high school gang culture is a key aspect of teenage life. Kadri dropped out of high school when he was 16, taking a job at Rolls-Royce as an apprentice in the gas-turbine division. Two years later he came to MIT, where he is now a full-time student. He also works part time as a management associate for the legendary L.A. music company Interscope Records, and helps a Silicon Valley venture capital firm connect with promising young entrepreneurs at MIT. On top of it all, he\u2019s developing a new business that he hopes will produce hybrid zero-emission drive systems for Jet Skis and motorbikes.\nKadri is precisely the kind of dynamic, unconventional student that Harvard would love to attract now that it\u2019s finally gotten into the tech-entrepreneurship game. But like Ash Martin, he never considered the school. \u201cHarvard may be the ultimate brand,\u201d he told me, but \u201cin a world that moves as fast as it does now, it\u2019s important to be focused and goal-oriented, and not just learn a bunch of stuff for its own sake. MIT reflects that world perfectly. And for me, MIT was the only way to go.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just the Trust Center that has made MIT so important and popular today. The amount of technological innovation and entrepreneurial activity taking place at any moment all over the campus is remarkable.\nEverybody knows about the Media Lab, of course. Founded in 1985, it\u2019s perhaps the world\u2019s most famous and productive seedbed of invention, a place where Thomas Edison would have felt at home, and perhaps even a little intimidated. Students at the Media Lab make science fiction come to life. Fabric-based computers, glucose-powered prosthetic limbs, robot skin made of sensory textiles, nanowires for the synthetic photosynthesis of liquid fuel\u2014the Media Lab does it all. Primarily designed to encourage creativity and innovation, the lab has nevertheless spawned more than 120 spinoff companies.\nLess known are the many other MIT initiatives related specifically to encouraging entrepreneurship. There\u2019s the annual MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, begun in 1990, which offers student entrepreneurs the chance to win a serious amount of startup money. The program is watched closely by venture capitalists and has been copied by dozens of universities across the country. Just this past year, for instance, Harvard created its own $100,000 student competition, called the President\u2019s Challenge.\nThen there\u2019s MIT\u2019s Deshpande Center, founded in 2002, which provides cash grants to teams of professors and students from across the university. Already it has awarded more than $11 million to more than 90 entrepreneurial projects, 26 of which have become commercial ventures. And this past summer the Institute kicked off yet another venture, the Founders\u2019 Skills Accelerator, which offers teams of students space inside the Trust Center to develop their companies. Each student receives a monthly $1,000 stipend, and teams can earn up to $20,000 if they hit a series of milestones aimed at turning their idea into a fully funded venture. Nearly 130 teams applied to the program. MIT had the money to accept only 10, but rather than just rejecting the remaining applicants, the university took the kind of creative step that has made it so appealing to students like Martin and Kadri: It found a neglected suite of offices on campus and created what\u2019s known as the Beehive Cooperative, where more than 40 teams are now at work on projects they\u2019d intended to complete as part of the Accelerator program. They don\u2019t get any prize money, but they\u2019ve got the space they need.\nAll of this represents a stunning achievement. MIT, founded a century and a half ago to serve the technological needs of the industrial age, has managed to transform itself into an incubator for the digital age. This kind of dramatic self-reinvention is almost unheard of for a major university. \u201cHistorically,\u201d says Arthur Levine, the president of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation and the former president of the Teachers College at Columbia, \u201cinstitutions have gotten one bite out of the apple, and never progressed to the new era. MIT is the only institution that\u2019s done both and is once again at the very forefront, ahead of any other institution.\u201d\nThat kind of talk doesn\u2019t go over well at Harvard, which likes to be a leader in everything it does. That\u2019s why the university has invested so much money in its Innovation Lab. The facility hosts classes taught by visiting entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, and offers students the chance to work with leading figures from all sectors of the business world. Teams of students can apply for workspace inside the facility to develop ideas and plan startups, and demand has been high. This fall the I-Lab is home to more than 60 teams, composed of 150 students\u2014most of them, not surprisingly, from the business school. One of those students is Levi Belnap, who\u2019s already founded a company with the help of the initiative. Belnap believes a promising new era of tech entrepreneurship is dawning at Harvard. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see more Harvard companies coming out of here,\u201d he says.\nThe odds that the I-Lab will help Harvard catch up to MIT, however, seem impossibly long. That\u2019s partly a reflection of cultural differences between the two schools. According to Christine Marcus, an MIT grad who recently spent time working at both the Trust Center and the I-Lab, something is just a bit off about the I-Lab. The atmosphere feels rigid, cloistered, sterile. Unlike the Trust Center, which is open to MIT students at all hours, the I-Lab closes at 1 a.m. during the week, is manned by a security guard, and requires students to sign in before entering. This kind of formality may seem normal to anyone who works in a conventional office, but to the up-and-coming generation of rebel innovators and entrepreneurs, it\u2019s just a buzzkill. \u201cI got to see both worlds,\u201d Marcus says, \u201cand they are definitely different cultures. At MIT, there\u2019s no pretense, and everyone is very humble and lets the work speak for itself. At Harvard, it\u2019s much more structured and formal. They try to help you and answer questions, they bring in speakers and mentors, but that same level of energy just isn\u2019t there.\u201d\nPartly, that\u2019s deliberate. Harvard isn\u2019t out to create businesses with its students, not even those at the I-Lab. Its primary concern, as always, is giving them a well-rounded education. \u201cWe don\u2019t push,\u201d says Joe Lassiter, the I-Lab\u2019s faculty chair. \u201cWe help.\u201d\nMIT, on the other hand, keeps pushing\u2014and that is why it\u2019s leaving Harvard behind. The world is changing dramatically, and MIT has decided to change with it. According to Sal Khan, a young Silicon Valley entrepreneur who went to MIT as an undergrad and earned an MBA from Harvard, the result is a new kind of MIT graduate, an entrepreneurial go-getter fully prepared to meet the challenges of the modern age. It\u2019s Khan\u2019s job to make bets on which young entrepreneurs will be the most successful, and he has no doubts about where to put his money. The modern MIT student, he believes, is battle-tested and ready to go. \u201cIt\u2019s analogous,\u201d he says, \u201cto someone being in Special Forces, or a Navy SEAL.\u201d",

Harvard is actually nearly a quarter-century late to the world of tech entrepreneurship, and as it scrambles to get into the game, it\u2019s finding itself in an uncomfortable position, not leading the charge, as it would like to, but desperately playing catch-up to its crosstown rival, MIT...

      "text": "\u00bfPor Qu\u00e9 Generar Contenido Cautivador es Imprescindible para el SEO?\nComo resultado de las \u00faltimas actualizaciones del algoritmo del motor de b\u00fasqueda, el contenido cautivador y de alta calidad debe ser un elemento integral de la p\u00e1gina web de una empresa y de la estrategia global de marketing online. Un flujo constante de contenido cautivador en tu sitio web muestra a los motores de b\u00fasqueda -, as\u00ed como a los clientes cada vez m\u00e1s inteligentes - que tu empresa est\u00e1 activa y es una fuente de informaci\u00f3n para la industria.\nEl gran contenido tambi\u00e9n puede ayudar a generar enlaces a p\u00e1ginas de su sitio desde otros editores, bloggers y autores. Estos enlaces entrantes resultan en el tr\u00e1fico de referencia y pueden ayudar a mejorar su posicionamiento en los buscadores.\nEstos son Algunos de los Factores Claves que Google Considera que son Indicadores de Alta Calidad:\nFormato de texto adecuado\nCorregir la ortograf\u00eda y la gram\u00e1tica\n Los enlaces salientes a otros sitios de alta calidad\n Los enlaces entrantes y participaciones sociales de otras fuentes de alta calidad\nUna estrategia de contenido adecuada requiere de una cantidad significativa de tiempo y talento. Sin embargo, como propietarios de un negocio online, puede que no tengan suficiente ancho de banda como para generar peri\u00f3dicamente y supervisar la creaci\u00f3n de contenido para su sitio web. Si ese es el caso, ustedes podr\u00edan considerar la contrataci\u00f3n de un director de contenidos que pueda crear y publicar documentos t\u00e9cnicos, blog posts, o incluso los libros electr\u00f3nicos para ustedes.\nUn lugar para buscar un director de contenidos es la red profesional LinkedIn. Comiencen por preguntar a las personas dentro de su red y empiezen a expandirse desde all\u00ed. Por ejemplo, seg\u00fan Salary.com, un salario promedio por un especialista de contenido en el \u00e1rea de Seattle es de $ 62.858. Si esto cae fuera de su rango de precio, pueden contratar a un escritor independiente que se especializa en su campo para ayudar en el desarrollo de contenidos.\nYa sea que ustedes mismos dirigen la creaci\u00f3n de contenidos o contratan a alguien, ustedes pueden beneficiarse de las siguientes estrategias de contenido:\nContenido Interno: Los blogs de la empresas son el formato m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil para la generaci\u00f3n de contenidos de alta calidad de forma constante en su sitio web. Mientras que un solo escritor o director de contenidos pueden gestionar un blog, ustedes podr\u00edan considerar la asignaci\u00f3n a varios empleados, cuyos art\u00edculos podr\u00eda dar a los lectores una visi\u00f3n m\u00e1s amplia de la empresa y la experiencia de su personal.\nMuchos de los sistemas de gesti\u00f3n de contenidos permiten la edici\u00f3n y la aprobaci\u00f3n del administrador antes de que los mensajes se puedan ver, para asegurar que el contenido es apropiado y que el formato, la ortograf\u00eda y la gram\u00e1tica son correctas. Es mas, un calendario mensual de contenido puede ayudarlos a ustedes o a un director de contenidos a organizar mensajes alrededor de los eventos de la empresa y campa\u00f1as de marketing.\nTambi\u00e9n pueden buscar la manera de reutilizar los blogs y otros contenidos en su sitio web. Por ejemplo, pueden ampliar una gran idea de un blog en una serie m\u00e1s larga o en un documento que se pueda descargar desde su sitio web.\nPublicaci\u00f3n de Contenido Externo: Ustedes y sus empleados no s\u00f3lo pueden escribir el contenido de su sitio web, sino que tambi\u00e9n pueden contribuir en blogs invitados a los editores externos. Postear como invitado en blogs y boletines para su industria pueden ser una forma efectiva de establecer su autoridad e influencia. Por supuesto, ustedes o su director de contenidos tendr\u00e1n que construir relaciones para asegurarse oportunidades de publicaci\u00f3n como invitados.\nLos Art\u00edculos como Invitados de Alta Calidad Son una Bendici\u00f3n para los Buscadores por Varias Razones:\nConstruyen enlaces entrantes a su sitio web, que son tratados como votos de credibilidad y de autoridad por los motores de b\u00fasqueda, lo que aumenta su ranking.\nConstruyen su Autor Rank, lo que mejora el ranking de todo el contenido que has creado para varias editoriales.\nEstablecen la conciencia de marca, lo que aumenta la exposici\u00f3n a los medios sociales, mejora su posicionamiento debido a la correlaci\u00f3n de las se\u00f1ales sociales con la optimizaci\u00f3n de motores de b\u00fasqueda (SEO).\nM\u00e1s All\u00e1 de la Palabra Escrita: Mientras que el foco principal del SEO es el texto que escriben normalmente, las empresas pueden demostrar su calidad de sitio web con podcasts, blogs de v\u00eddeos y otros contenidos visuales. Tambi\u00e9n pueden atraer tr\u00e1fico con videos cortos en Vine, presentaciones de diapositivas personalizadas en SlideShare o en Pinterest. Este enfoque multimedia para la comercializaci\u00f3n de contenidos mejora el posicionamiento en los buscadores de manera similar a la publicaci\u00f3n de resultados.\nPublicar v\u00eddeos y otros tipos de medios de comunicaci\u00f3n, tales como diapositivas de PowerPoint, tambi\u00e9n puede hacer que su contenido quede clasificado en motores de b\u00fasqueda que no sean Google \u2013 como YouTube para los v\u00eddeos y SlideShare para las dispositivas de PowerPoint. Este alcance m\u00e1s amplio puede conducir a una mayor exposici\u00f3n de la marca y el conocimiento, la construcci\u00f3n de los canales de medios sociales y contribuir se\u00f1ales sociales positivas. Por otra parte, el aumento de la exposici\u00f3n puede atraer m\u00e1s enlaces entrantes de otros autores y editores, ya que hacen referencia a su trabajo.\nCon los nuevos medios sociales y plataformas editoriales apareciendo regularmente, las empresas pueden mantener su relevancia, centr\u00e1ndose en la creaci\u00f3n de contenido de alta calidad y atractivo a trav\u00e9s de m\u00faltiples plataformas. Eso puede conducir al desarrollo de marca y conocimiento, junto con el aumento del tr\u00e1fico del sitio web, clientes potenciales y ventas.\nEspero que les haya sido \u00fatil.\nSaludos\nJuan\nJuan Coccaro]]>",

      "text": "It\u2019s not just the Trust Center that has made MIT so important and popular today. The amount of technological innovation and entrepreneurial activity taking place at any moment all over the campus is remarkable.\nEverybody knows about the Media Lab, of course. Founded in 1985, it\u2019s perhaps the world\u2019s most famous and productive seedbed of invention, a place where Thomas Edison would have felt at home, and perhaps even a little intimidated. Students at the Media Lab make science fiction come to life. Fabric-based computers, glucose-powered prosthetic limbs, robot skin made of sensory textiles, nanowires for the synthetic photosynthesis of liquid fuel\u2014the Media Lab does it all. Primarily designed to encourage creativity and innovation, the lab has nevertheless spawned more than 120 spinoff companies.\nLess known are the many other MIT initiatives related specifically to encouraging entrepreneurship. There\u2019s the annual MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, begun in 1990, which offers student entrepreneurs the chance to win a serious amount of startup money. The program is watched closely by venture capitalists and has been copied by dozens of universities across the country. Just this past year, for instance, Harvard created its own $100,000 student competition, called the President\u2019s Challenge.\nThen there\u2019s MIT\u2019s Deshpande Center, founded in 2002, which provides cash grants to teams of professors and students from across the university. Already it has awarded more than $11 million to more than 90 entrepreneurial projects, 26 of which have become commercial ventures. And this past summer the Institute kicked off yet another venture, the Founders\u2019 Skills Accelerator, which offers teams of students space inside the Trust Center to develop their companies. Each student receives a monthly $1,000 stipend, and teams can earn up to $20,000 if they hit a series of milestones aimed at turning their idea into a fully funded venture. Nearly 130 teams applied to the program. MIT had the money to accept only 10, but rather than just rejecting the remaining applicants, the university took the kind of creative step that has made it so appealing to students like Martin and Kadri: It found a neglected suite of offices on campus and created what\u2019s known as the Beehive Cooperative, where more than 40 teams are now at work on projects they\u2019d intended to complete as part of the Accelerator program. They don\u2019t get any prize money, but they\u2019ve got the space they need.\nAll of this represents a stunning achievement. MIT, founded a century and a half ago to serve the technological needs of the industrial age, has managed to transform itself into an incubator for the digital age. This kind of dramatic self-reinvention is almost unheard of for a major university. \u201cHistorically,\u201d says Arthur Levine, the president of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation and the former president of the Teachers College at Columbia, \u201cinstitutions have gotten one bite out of the apple, and never progressed to the new era. MIT is the only institution that\u2019s done both and is once again at the very forefront, ahead of any other institution.\u201d\nThat kind of talk doesn\u2019t go over well at Harvard, which likes to be a leader in everything it does. That\u2019s why the university has invested so much money in its Innovation Lab. The facility hosts classes taught by visiting entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, and offers students the chance to work with leading figures from all sectors of the business world. Teams of students can apply for workspace inside the facility to develop ideas and plan startups, and demand has been high. This fall the I-Lab is home to more than 60 teams, composed of 150 students\u2014most of them, not surprisingly, from the business school. One of those students is Levi Belnap, who\u2019s already founded a company with the help of the initiative. Belnap believes a promising new era of tech entrepreneurship is dawning at Harvard. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see more Harvard companies coming out of here,\u201d he says.\nThe odds that the I-Lab will help Harvard catch up to MIT, however, seem impossibly long. That\u2019s partly a reflection of cultural differences between the two schools. According to Christine Marcus, an MIT grad who recently spent time working at both the Trust Center and the I-Lab, something is just a bit off about the I-Lab. The atmosphere feels rigid, cloistered, sterile. Unlike the Trust Center, which is open to MIT students at all hours, the I-Lab closes at 1 a.m. during the week, is manned by a security guard, and requires students to sign in before entering. This kind of formality may seem normal to anyone who works in a conventional office, but to the up-and-coming generation of rebel innovators and entrepreneurs, it\u2019s just a buzzkill. \u201cI got to see both worlds,\u201d Marcus says, \u201cand they are definitely different cultures. At MIT, there\u2019s no pretense, and everyone is very humble and lets the work speak for itself. At Harvard, it\u2019s much more structured and formal. They try to help you and answer questions, they bring in speakers and mentors, but that same level of energy just isn\u2019t there.\u201d\nPartly, that\u2019s deliberate. Harvard isn\u2019t out to create businesses with its students, not even those at the I-Lab. Its primary concern, as always, is giving them a well-rounded education. \u201cWe don\u2019t push,\u201d says Joe Lassiter, the I-Lab\u2019s faculty chair. \u201cWe help.\u201d\nMIT, on the other hand, keeps pushing\u2014and that is why it\u2019s leaving Harvard behind. The world is changing dramatically, and MIT has decided to change with it. According to Sal Khan, a young Silicon Valley entrepreneur who went to MIT as an undergrad and earned an MBA from Harvard, the result is a new kind of MIT graduate, an entrepreneurial go-getter fully prepared to meet the challenges of the modern age. It\u2019s Khan\u2019s job to make bets on which young entrepreneurs will be the most successful, and he has no doubts about where to put his money. The modern MIT student, he believes, is battle-tested and ready to go. \u201cIt\u2019s analogous,\u201d he says, \u201cto someone being in Special Forces, or a Navy SEAL.\u201d",

      "text": "Ash Martin certainly never wanted to go to Harvard. Why would he? In his view, Harvard spits out CEOs, bankers, lawyers, and moneymen. That\u2019s so 1990s. (Photo by Jesse Burke)\nMIT has long been the home of the nerd whose idea of fun is staying up late solving equations and writing code. But that\u2019s changing fast. Droves of energetic young rebels, risk takers, and mavericks are now arriving at the university, hoping to make it big as tech entrepreneurs, and they\u2019re transforming the spirit of the place. As improbable as it might seem, MIT has gone from geek to chic. \u201cI lecture all around at different schools, like Babson, Emerson, BU, BC, Harvard, and MIT,\u201d says Brian Patrick Halligan, a graduate of MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management and the CEO and founder of the successful Cambridge-based marketing-software business HubSpot. \u201cAnd MIT kids are by far the best. They\u2019re smart, articulate, covered in tattoos\u2014they\u2019re cool and hip and very different. Their clothes are edgy. And they\u2019re all starting companies.\u201d\nAsh Martin, in his second year at Sloan, is exactly the kind of student Halligan is talking about. A cofounder of Viztu Technologies, which creates software that allows anyone to take and print digital 3-D images, Martin is blonde and brawny, with chiseled movie-star looks\u2014and yes, he has tattoos. He plays water polo. He looks like a rock-star surfer, not someone who\u2019s been hunkered down for the past year in the technological trenches, making breakthroughs in 3-D technology.\nMartin is at the vanguard of change. Traditional careers in banking, medicine, and the law, which once promised lavish salaries and long-term sustainability, no longer provide a guaranteed route to success. The American Bar Association announced in June, for instance, that in 2011 only 55 percent of the nation\u2019s law school graduates had landed full-time jobs within nine months of graduation. Overall, there are fewer \u201cforever\u201d jobs. Thousands of talented young students who might previously have considered these traditional careers are now deciding to go it on their own as entrepreneurs\u2014and they\u2019re choosing colleges and universities accordingly.\nMartin shatters the geek stereotype, yet he feels right at home at MIT. \u201cIt\u2019s full of my people,\u201d he says, \u201cthe roll-up-your-sleeves-and-get-it-done people. This is where it\u2019s at, and where I want to be.\u201d Martin certainly never considered Harvard. Why would he? In his view, Harvard spits out CEOs, bankers, lawyers, and moneymen. That\u2019s so 1990s. Like so many others in his generation, he doesn\u2019t want to be just a businessman, or a tech geek who makes things work behind the scenes. He wants to be like Steve Jobs, an iconoclastic master of the universe, a tech wizard with culture-changing powers. He chose MIT specifically because, in the new global economy, it offered him the best chance to realize his dreams: to start a business and make a difference in the world, not to mention earn some serious cash. On all of those fronts, he\u2019s well on his way. A few months ago, he and his partner sold Viztu Technologies for an undisclosed sum to an international outfit called 3D Systems.\n\u201cTech entrepreneurship is becoming a profession akin to law or architecture,\u201d says Noubar Afeyan, the CEO of the Cambridge-based venture capital firm Flagship Ventures. \u201cAnd that\u2019s increasingly causing people to say, \u2018How do I prepare for this and arm myself to tip the odds in my favor?\u2019\u201d These days, for those lucky enough to get in, there\u2019s a simple answer to that question.\nGo to MIT.\nRomi Kadri, full-time MIT student and entrepreneurial jack of all trades. (Photo by Jesse Burke)\nThat\u2019s exactly what I did one afternoon this past August. Universities often feel deserted in the summer, but when I arrived at the Trust Center, the hub of MIT\u2019s entrepreneurial efforts, I found the place crackling with life.\nAn independent entity within MIT, the center offers students from all parts of the Institute a wealth of resources: expert mentors, office space, classes on entrepreneurship, and networking opportunities with not only other students and faculty but also outside businesspeople and venture capitalists. Certain specialized programs\u2014ones involving mentoring and grants, for example\u2014require students to apply and be accepted, but any MIT student interested in entrepreneurship can register for classes, meet with experts about an idea for a company, or join one of the 14 student clubs dedicated to creating businesses. The center began in 1990 by offering one class, taught by an adjunct professor, but today has more than 30 courses, taught by 35 faculty members from all over MIT, and offers an MBA track with Sloan in entrepreneurship and innovation. And student interest has skyrocketed. In 1996 only 288 students took entrepreneurship courses. Now approximately 1,500 sign up for them every year.\nFrom the outside, the center doesn\u2019t look like much. It\u2019s hidden inside a drab, unremarkable building on the MIT campus, known to all simply as E40. When you enter, though, you find yourself in a space that\u2019s cheery, modern, and bright. Most walls are covered in whiteboard paint for students to scribble on as they work, and those that aren\u2019t have been painted an intense shade of orange. At only 4,000 square feet, it\u2019s a small space, long and narrow, but MIT has made the most of it, packing in open-air cubicles, a few phone-booth-size offices, some bigger glass-walled workrooms, a video-conference room, and a kitchenette filled with cases of free energy drinks and ramen noodles.\nMost of the real work gets done in an open area at the rear of the suite. When I got there, I found clusters of students in T-shirts at a number of movable tables on wheels. In one corner, a small group was discussing the development of solar panels designed to power cell phones. Several desks away, two women were working out the kinks in a plan to create an iTunes-like marketplace for photographs and paintings. A group of guys near them was talking through the design of a super-slippery plastic container that would make even honey and ketchup slide easily out of bottles, a high-tech bid to capture part of the $33-billion-a-year condiment industry. The space was buzzing with activity, and as I wandered around it was easy to believe that somewhere in the room with me might be the next Jobs or Zuckerberg.\nSeveral days later, at a nearby coffee shop, I met Romi Kadri, a junior from Scotland. Tan, fit, and 21 years old, Kadri has a warm smile and the ceaseless energy of a Red Bull addict. He wrote his first business plan when he was nine. When he was 15, he introduced the owners of a mom-and-pop bicycle store in his hometown to the Internet and proceeded to transform their operation into an online powerhouse. Just another MIT geek, right? No. He grew up in Glasglow, where navigating the city\u2019s notorious high school gang culture is a key aspect of teenage life. Kadri dropped out of high school when he was 16, taking a job at Rolls-Royce as an apprentice in the gas-turbine division. Two years later he came to MIT, where he is now a full-time student. He also works part time as a management associate for the legendary L.A. music company Interscope Records, and helps a Silicon Valley venture capital firm connect with promising young entrepreneurs at MIT. On top of it all, he\u2019s developing a new business that he hopes will produce hybrid zero-emission drive systems for Jet Skis and motorbikes.\nKadri is precisely the kind of dynamic, unconventional student that Harvard would love to attract now that it\u2019s finally gotten into the tech-entrepreneurship game. But like Ash Martin, he never considered the school. \u201cHarvard may be the ultimate brand,\u201d he told me, but \u201cin a world that moves as fast as it does now, it\u2019s important to be focused and goal-oriented, and not just learn a bunch of stuff for its own sake. MIT reflects that world perfectly. And for me, MIT was the only way to go.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just the Trust Center that has made MIT so important and popular today. The amount of technological innovation and entrepreneurial activity taking place at any moment all over the campus is remarkable.\nEverybody knows about the Media Lab, of course. Founded in 1985, it\u2019s perhaps the world\u2019s most famous and productive seedbed of invention, a place where Thomas Edison would have felt at home, and perhaps even a little intimidated. Students at the Media Lab make science fiction come to life. Fabric-based computers, glucose-powered prosthetic limbs, robot skin made of sensory textiles, nanowires for the synthetic photosynthesis of liquid fuel\u2014the Media Lab does it all. Primarily designed to encourage creativity and innovation, the lab has nevertheless spawned more than 120 spinoff companies.\nLess known are the many other MIT initiatives related specifically to encouraging entrepreneurship. There\u2019s the annual MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, begun in 1990, which offers student entrepreneurs the chance to win a serious amount of startup money. The program is watched closely by venture capitalists and has been copied by dozens of universities across the country. Just this past year, for instance, Harvard created its own $100,000 student competition, called the President\u2019s Challenge.\nThen there\u2019s MIT\u2019s Deshpande Center, founded in 2002, which provides cash grants to teams of professors and students from across the university. Already it has awarded more than $11 million to more than 90 entrepreneurial projects, 26 of which have become commercial ventures. And this past summer the Institute kicked off yet another venture, the Founders\u2019 Skills Accelerator, which offers teams of students space inside the Trust Center to develop their companies. Each student receives a monthly $1,000 stipend, and teams can earn up to $20,000 if they hit a series of milestones aimed at turning their idea into a fully funded venture. Nearly 130 teams applied to the program. MIT had the money to accept only 10, but rather than just rejecting the remaining applicants, the university took the kind of creative step that has made it so appealing to students like Martin and Kadri: It found a neglected suite of offices on campus and created what\u2019s known as the Beehive Cooperative, where more than 40 teams are now at work on projects they\u2019d intended to complete as part of the Accelerator program. They don\u2019t get any prize money, but they\u2019ve got the space they need.\nAll of this represents a stunning achievement. MIT, founded a century and a half ago to serve the technological needs of the industrial age, has managed to transform itself into an incubator for the digital age. This kind of dramatic self-reinvention is almost unheard of for a major university. \u201cHistorically,\u201d says Arthur Levine, the president of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation and the former president of the Teachers College at Columbia, \u201cinstitutions have gotten one bite out of the apple, and never progressed to the new era. MIT is the only institution that\u2019s done both and is once again at the very forefront, ahead of any other institution.\u201d\nThat kind of talk doesn\u2019t go over well at Harvard, which likes to be a leader in everything it does. That\u2019s why the university has invested so much money in its Innovation Lab. The facility hosts classes taught by visiting entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, and offers students the chance to work with leading figures from all sectors of the business world. Teams of students can apply for workspace inside the facility to develop ideas and plan startups, and demand has been high. This fall the I-Lab is home to more than 60 teams, composed of 150 students\u2014most of them, not surprisingly, from the business school. One of those students is Levi Belnap, who\u2019s already founded a company with the help of the initiative. Belnap believes a promising new era of tech entrepreneurship is dawning at Harvard. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see more Harvard companies coming out of here,\u201d he says.\nThe odds that the I-Lab will help Harvard catch up to MIT, however, seem impossibly long. That\u2019s partly a reflection of cultural differences between the two schools. According to Christine Marcus, an MIT grad who recently spent time working at both the Trust Center and the I-Lab, something is just a bit off about the I-Lab. The atmosphere feels rigid, cloistered, sterile. Unlike the Trust Center, which is open to MIT students at all hours, the I-Lab closes at 1 a.m. during the week, is manned by a security guard, and requires students to sign in before entering. This kind of formality may seem normal to anyone who works in a conventional office, but to the up-and-coming generation of rebel innovators and entrepreneurs, it\u2019s just a buzzkill. \u201cI got to see both worlds,\u201d Marcus says, \u201cand they are definitely different cultures. At MIT, there\u2019s no pretense, and everyone is very humble and lets the work speak for itself. At Harvard, it\u2019s much more structured and formal. They try to help you and answer questions, they bring in speakers and mentors, but that same level of energy just isn\u2019t there.\u201d\nPartly, that\u2019s deliberate. Harvard isn\u2019t out to create businesses with its students, not even those at the I-Lab. Its primary concern, as always, is giving them a well-rounded education. \u201cWe don\u2019t push,\u201d says Joe Lassiter, the I-Lab\u2019s faculty chair. \u201cWe help.\u201d\nMIT, on the other hand, keeps pushing\u2014and that is why it\u2019s leaving Harvard behind. The world is changing dramatically, and MIT has decided to change with it. According to Sal Khan, a young Silicon Valley entrepreneur who went to MIT as an undergrad and earned an MBA from Harvard, the result is a new kind of MIT graduate, an entrepreneurial go-getter fully prepared to meet the challenges of the modern age. It\u2019s Khan\u2019s job to make bets on which young entrepreneurs will be the most successful, and he has no doubts about where to put his money. The modern MIT student, he believes, is battle-tested and ready to go. \u201cIt\u2019s analogous,\u201d he says, \u201cto someone being in Special Forces, or a Navy SEAL.\u201d",

      "text": "Romi Kadri, full-time MIT student and entrepreneurial jack of all trades. (Photo by Jesse Burke)\nThat\u2019s exactly what I did one afternoon this past August. Universities often feel deserted in the summer, but when I arrived at the Trust Center, the hub of MIT\u2019s entrepreneurial efforts, I found the place crackling with life.\nAn independent entity within MIT, the center offers students from all parts of the Institute a wealth of resources: expert mentors, office space, classes on entrepreneurship, and networking opportunities with not only other students and faculty but also outside businesspeople and venture capitalists. Certain specialized programs\u2014ones involving mentoring and grants, for example\u2014require students to apply and be accepted, but any MIT student interested in entrepreneurship can register for classes, meet with experts about an idea for a company, or join one of the 14 student clubs dedicated to creating businesses. The center began in 1990 by offering one class, taught by an adjunct professor, but today has more than 30 courses, taught by 35 faculty members from all over MIT, and offers an MBA track with Sloan in entrepreneurship and innovation. And student interest has skyrocketed. In 1996 only 288 students took entrepreneurship courses. Now approximately 1,500 sign up for them every year.\nFrom the outside, the center doesn\u2019t look like much. It\u2019s hidden inside a drab, unremarkable building on the MIT campus, known to all simply as E40. When you enter, though, you find yourself in a space that\u2019s cheery, modern, and bright. Most walls are covered in whiteboard paint for students to scribble on as they work, and those that aren\u2019t have been painted an intense shade of orange. At only 4,000 square feet, it\u2019s a small space, long and narrow, but MIT has made the most of it, packing in open-air cubicles, a few phone-booth-size offices, some bigger glass-walled workrooms, a video-conference room, and a kitchenette filled with cases of free energy drinks and ramen noodles.\nMost of the real work gets done in an open area at the rear of the suite. When I got there, I found clusters of students in T-shirts at a number of movable tables on wheels. In one corner, a small group was discussing the development of solar panels designed to power cell phones. Several desks away, two women were working out the kinks in a plan to create an iTunes-like marketplace for photographs and paintings. A group of guys near them was talking through the design of a super-slippery plastic container that would make even honey and ketchup slide easily out of bottles, a high-tech bid to capture part of the $33-billion-a-year condiment industry. The space was buzzing with activity, and as I wandered around it was easy to believe that somewhere in the room with me might be the next Jobs or Zuckerberg.\nSeveral days later, at a nearby coffee shop, I met Romi Kadri, a junior from Scotland. Tan, fit, and 21 years old, Kadri has a warm smile and the ceaseless energy of a Red Bull addict. He wrote his first business plan when he was nine. When he was 15, he introduced the owners of a mom-and-pop bicycle store in his hometown to the Internet and proceeded to transform their operation into an online powerhouse. Just another MIT geek, right? No. He grew up in Glasglow, where navigating the city\u2019s notorious high school gang culture is a key aspect of teenage life. Kadri dropped out of high school when he was 16, taking a job at Rolls-Royce as an apprentice in the gas-turbine division. Two years later he came to MIT, where he is now a full-time student. He also works part time as a management associate for the legendary L.A. music company Interscope Records, and helps a Silicon Valley venture capital firm connect with promising young entrepreneurs at MIT. On top of it all, he\u2019s developing a new business that he hopes will produce hybrid zero-emission drive systems for Jet Skis and motorbikes.\nKadri is precisely the kind of dynamic, unconventional student that Harvard would love to attract now that it\u2019s finally gotten into the tech-entrepreneurship game. But like Ash Martin, he never considered the school. \u201cHarvard may be the ultimate brand,\u201d he told me, but \u201cin a world that moves as fast as it does now, it\u2019s important to be focused and goal-oriented, and not just learn a bunch of stuff for its own sake. MIT reflects that world perfectly. And for me, MIT was the only way to go.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just the Trust Center that has made MIT so important and popular today. The amount of technological innovation and entrepreneurial activity taking place at any moment all over the campus is remarkable.\nEverybody knows about the Media Lab, of course. Founded in 1985, it\u2019s perhaps the world\u2019s most famous and productive seedbed of invention, a place where Thomas Edison would have felt at home, and perhaps even a little intimidated. Students at the Media Lab make science fiction come to life. Fabric-based computers, glucose-powered prosthetic limbs, robot skin made of sensory textiles, nanowires for the synthetic photosynthesis of liquid fuel\u2014the Media Lab does it all. Primarily designed to encourage creativity and innovation, the lab has nevertheless spawned more than 120 spinoff companies.\nLess known are the many other MIT initiatives related specifically to encouraging entrepreneurship. There\u2019s the annual MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, begun in 1990, which offers student entrepreneurs the chance to win a serious amount of startup money. The program is watched closely by venture capitalists and has been copied by dozens of universities across the country. Just this past year, for instance, Harvard created its own $100,000 student competition, called the President\u2019s Challenge.\nThen there\u2019s MIT\u2019s Deshpande Center, founded in 2002, which provides cash grants to teams of professors and students from across the university. Already it has awarded more than $11 million to more than 90 entrepreneurial projects, 26 of which have become commercial ventures. And this past summer the Institute kicked off yet another venture, the Founders\u2019 Skills Accelerator, which offers teams of students space inside the Trust Center to develop their companies. Each student receives a monthly $1,000 stipend, and teams can earn up to $20,000 if they hit a series of milestones aimed at turning their idea into a fully funded venture. Nearly 130 teams applied to the program. MIT had the money to accept only 10, but rather than just rejecting the remaining applicants, the university took the kind of creative step that has made it so appealing to students like Martin and Kadri: It found a neglected suite of offices on campus and created what\u2019s known as the Beehive Cooperative, where more than 40 teams are now at work on projects they\u2019d intended to complete as part of the Accelerator program. They don\u2019t get any prize money, but they\u2019ve got the space they need.\nAll of this represents a stunning achievement. MIT, founded a century and a half ago to serve the technological needs of the industrial age, has managed to transform itself into an incubator for the digital age. This kind of dramatic self-reinvention is almost unheard of for a major university. \u201cHistorically,\u201d says Arthur Levine, the president of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation and the former president of the Teachers College at Columbia, \u201cinstitutions have gotten one bite out of the apple, and never progressed to the new era. MIT is the only institution that\u2019s done both and is once again at the very forefront, ahead of any other institution.\u201d\nThat kind of talk doesn\u2019t go over well at Harvard, which likes to be a leader in everything it does. That\u2019s why the university has invested so much money in its Innovation Lab. The facility hosts classes taught by visiting entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, and offers students the chance to work with leading figures from all sectors of the business world. Teams of students can apply for workspace inside the facility to develop ideas and plan startups, and demand has been high. This fall the I-Lab is home to more than 60 teams, composed of 150 students\u2014most of them, not surprisingly, from the business school. One of those students is Levi Belnap, who\u2019s already founded a company with the help of the initiative. Belnap believes a promising new era of tech entrepreneurship is dawning at Harvard. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see more Harvard companies coming out of here,\u201d he says.\nThe odds that the I-Lab will help Harvard catch up to MIT, however, seem impossibly long. That\u2019s partly a reflection of cultural differences between the two schools. According to Christine Marcus, an MIT grad who recently spent time working at both the Trust Center and the I-Lab, something is just a bit off about the I-Lab. The atmosphere feels rigid, cloistered, sterile. Unlike the Trust Center, which is open to MIT students at all hours, the I-Lab closes at 1 a.m. during the week, is manned by a security guard, and requires students to sign in before entering. This kind of formality may seem normal to anyone who works in a conventional office, but to the up-and-coming generation of rebel innovators and entrepreneurs, it\u2019s just a buzzkill. \u201cI got to see both worlds,\u201d Marcus says, \u201cand they are definitely different cultures. At MIT, there\u2019s no pretense, and everyone is very humble and lets the work speak for itself. At Harvard, it\u2019s much more structured and formal. They try to help you and answer questions, they bring in speakers and mentors, but that same level of energy just isn\u2019t there.\u201d\nPartly, that\u2019s deliberate. Harvard isn\u2019t out to create businesses with its students, not even those at the I-Lab. Its primary concern, as always, is giving them a well-rounded education. \u201cWe don\u2019t push,\u201d says Joe Lassiter, the I-Lab\u2019s faculty chair. \u201cWe help.\u201d\nMIT, on the other hand, keeps pushing\u2014and that is why it\u2019s leaving Harvard behind. The world is changing dramatically, and MIT has decided to change with it. According to Sal Khan, a young Silicon Valley entrepreneur who went to MIT as an undergrad and earned an MBA from Harvard, the result is a new kind of MIT graduate, an entrepreneurial go-getter fully prepared to meet the challenges of the modern age. It\u2019s Khan\u2019s job to make bets on which young entrepreneurs will be the most successful, and he has no doubts about where to put his money. The modern MIT student, he believes, is battle-tested and ready to go. \u201cIt\u2019s analogous,\u201d he says, \u201cto someone being in Special Forces, or a Navy SEAL.\u201d",

So instead of our regular Logo Design News which we post nearly every Friday, here\u2019s a round up of links from around the web that we recommend for small business owners:\nEntrepreneur Breakdowns and Breakthroughs\n Key Idea (actually there are lots of great ideas in this video): \u201cI\u2019ve had my share of failures. That\u2019s kinda what makes a person ready for success.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the whole video:\nFrom Inc Magazine: An Interview with Sir Richard Branson on entrepreneurial audacity.\n Key Idea: \u201c\u2026true audaciousness comes about with just those people who have the pluck and the courage to say: Screw it; let\u2019s do it.\u201d (Bonus: here are 9 inspiring things Richard Branson has said about small business.)\nMore from Inc Magazine: 6 TED Talks Every Entrepreneur Should Watch. Lots of good stuff here from insights on creativity to disagreement.\nFrom Ryan Carson, CEO of Treehouse: 3 Mistakes Every Entrepreneur Should Avoid.\n Key Idea: \u201cI met with our accountant quarterly to sign off the accounts and it always felt like a nuisance. I thought all that mattered was the cash-flow\u2026 I was just focusing on how much cash we had and whether we had enough to make it through the next three months.\u201d Lots of good stuff in the comments too.\nFrom Paul Graham: How to Get Start-up Ideas. It\u2019s long but worth it.\n Key Idea: \u201cWhy do so many founders build things no one wants? Because they begin by trying to think of startup ideas. That m.o. is doubly dangerous: it doesn\u2019t merely yield few good ideas; it yields bad ideas that sound plausible enough to fool you into working on them.\u201d Sounds like advice from the excellent book: Nail It Then Scale It.\nFrom David Hauser: 25 Entrepreneurs Tell What they Wish They\u2019d Known\u2026\n Key Idea: \u201cSince entrepreneurs are the most qualified to give other entrepreneurs advice about starting a business, I decided to ask 25 entrepreneurs about the number one thing they wish they\u2019d known before founding their first startup\u2026 It\u2019s invaluable whether you\u2019ve recently started a business or you\u2019re looking to start one.\u201d",

I'm getting to that!\n02:44:56<dominictarr>so, the thing that is soooooo great about level db\n02:45:05<dominictarr>is that it's only the HARD part of a data base\n02:45:05<Raynos>dominictarr: https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup/issues/29\n02:45:31<dominictarr>& we get to build all the soft parts in js.\n02:45:52<dominictarr>this is the javascript way: polyfills all the way down.\n02:46:22<dominictarr>we just get given a crappy, but basically there API from the browser, or whatever\n02:46:29<dominictarr>and then we polyfill it in JS\n02:46:49<dominictarr>when you think about it, node.js is really just a polyfill.\n02:47:25<dominictarr>rvagg, so basically, we are building the other features that a database normally has\n02:47:42<rvagg>re hooks, can't you just mess with __proto__ ?\n02:47:42<dominictarr>but since we are doing it in JS we can make it really flexible and modular.\n02:47:55<dominictarr>rvagg, so, you COULD\n02:48:31<dominictarr>but we'd probably get better compatibility if we figured out a more disiplined way to do it.\n02:48:50<dominictarr>so, one thing you need is a queue system\n02:49:15<dominictarr>I'm using this already to make map-reduce reliable\n02:49:37<dominictarr>so, like, if the process crashes, we need to restart unfinished map-reduce jobs\n02:50:10<dominictarr>so, we need a reliable job queue for that.\n02:50:18<dominictarr>but if we expose that feature,\n02:50:26<dominictarr>then we get a DB with a job queue too!\n02:50:53<dominictarr>and in some applications, maybe you don't care about M-R\n02:51:02<dominictarr>but you want job queues\n02:51:32<dominictarr>with levelup, you can have that.\n02:52:26<Raynos>Im thinking that before and after events might be the same as hooks\n02:53:04<Raynos>whats the performance penalty between put and batch with a single value?\n02:53:08<dominictarr>Raynos, well, for the queue to work right, we need to turn a PUT into a BATCH\n02:53:22<rvagg>Raynos: we can test that now!\n02:53:32<Raynos>i mean you can implement before and after as hooks not the other way around\n02:53:38<dominictarr>you could also implement a scuttlebutt style replication with that method.\n02:53:48<dominictarr>Raynos, yes.\n02:54:05<dominictarr>even SQL has triggers.\n02:54:15<dominictarr>it's the same thing, but more flexible\n02:54:43<substack>https://github.com/substack/shell-stream/blob/master/server.js\n02:54:48<substack>ssh over http, pretty much\n02:55:06<substack>now I just need to figure out how to make

just write a wrapper around a readStream() cause that's what it'd be doing anyway--an iterator ending prematurely\n23:44:30<dominictarr>rvagg, you just destroy the stream after the first

anyway\n23:45:25<dominictarr>ralphtheninja, ^ you could use that to implement MVCC\n23:46:06<dominictarr>rvagg, you could make an option that was {start: x, n: number} though, right?\n23:46:29<dominictarr>(as long as it's possible, then can defer that :)\n23:46:32<Raynos>dominictarr: just use take\n23:46:36<Raynos>take(stream,

it\n23:48:41<Raynos>doesnt look like it\n23:48:42<dominictarr>that is reasonable behavior for pause.\n23:49:12<Raynos>oh wait\n23:49:14<Raynos>I see.\n23:49:56<Raynos>rvagg:

suppose\n23:51:30<rvagg>actually, maybe I'm wrong!\n23:51:40<dominictarr>to be fast we need it to stop reading the database when you pause.\n23:51:42<rvagg>Raynos: check out the _read implementaiton, it only goes ahead if you're \"ready\"\n23:52:04<Raynos>oh true\n23:52:09<Raynos>and you change status to ready+paused\n23:52:11<Raynos>so its cool\n23:52:19<Raynos>yeah it respects pause\n23:52:22<rvagg>I have a slow-stream test in there to make sure it follows the correct stream backpressue semantics, it should be all good\n23:52:48<rvagg>I put a lot of sweat into that darn stream implementation... made me hate implementing streams even more\n23:52:58<Raynos>use an abstraction\n23:53:15<Raynos>https://github.com/Raynos/levelidb/blob/master/index.js#L109\n23:53:20<rvagg>use streams2\n23:53:30<dominictarr>rvagg, stream2 arn't stable yet\n23:53:35<rvagg>ya, I know\n23:53:37<rvagg>getting there..\n23:54:06<dominictarr>we can test the streams with stream-spec\n23:54:49<Raynos>yeah I use streams2 through read-stream\n23:55:06<Raynos>but thats probably suboptimum\n23:55:22<Raynos>best to jsut wait for 0.10\n23:58:03<ralphtheninja>is there any quick way to go to a corresponding github-repo for a npm module?\n23:58:45<dominictarr>ralphtheninja, there

different things :D\n00:22:47<Raynos>if you want streaming base classes use read-stream, write-stream and read-write-stream\n00:22:52<Raynos>which are all horrible names\n00:23:41* mikealquit (Quit:

:)\n00:25:14<ralphtheninja>gotcha\n00:27:06<Raynos>cool\n00:27:13<Raynos>another tip is\n00:30:17<Raynos>piping npm search into xargs npm docs\n00:32:05<Raynos>dominictarr, substack: I just realized that I get annoyed at the amount of plumbing it takes to set up reconnect and pipe together network streams & mux demux but tolerate so much bullshit setting up XHR and REST end points\n00:32:35<dominictarr>there is waaaay more bullshit writing REST\n00:32:41<Raynos>why do I even do REST\n00:32:51<Raynos>why do I even tolerate it\n00:32:53<dominictarr>like you have to write all these requests, and then all these responses\n00:32:59<dominictarr>but it's the same stuff\n00:33:26<Raynos>I was finding this connect function annoying: https://gist.github.com/4116665#L40\n00:36:24<Raynos>but now im writing REST end points\n00:36:26<Raynos>and dear god\n00:36:27<Raynos>._.\n00:36:33<Raynos>\\there is no comparison\n00:37:00<mbalho>could there be a module that abstracts duplex piping syntax\n00:37:07<mbalho>npm install luigi\n00:37:14<mbalho>and npm install mario\n00:37:14<Raynos>you cant\n00:37:29<mbalho>peerStream.pipe(peers.createStream()).pipe(peerStream) is 3 function calls\n00:37:30<Raynos>i thoughta bout abstracting it\n00:37:37<Raynos>but those are the network streams\n00:37:41<Raynos>network streams disconnect\n00:37:49<Raynos>and reconnection logic is very application specific\n00:37:58<Raynos>you need to expose streaming interfaces and pipes\n00:38:14<Raynos>although I guess we can have a function called duplex\n00:38:18<Raynos>that does the duplex pattern\n00:38:24<Raynos>duplex(peerStream, peers.createStream())\n00:38:35<Raynos>but why bother\n00:38:38<mbalho>yea\n00:38:52<Raynos>ive tried this before\n00:39:13<Raynos>https://github.com/Raynos/mux-demux-shoe#example-server\n00:39:17<jjjjohnnny>npm install ouroboros\n00:39:23<Raynos>but your baking in how to handle network disconnects

think\n19:25:53<ralphtheninja>agree\n19:26:20<dominictarr>and he's right about that having your own data is a ideology not a usecase\n19:26:48<ralphtheninja>there are other successful p2p things, so I don't see why it should fail because being decentralized\n19:27:23<dominictarr>no, but it to get big, it needs to be useful with just a few users.\n19:27:27<dominictarr>and then grow\n19:28:26<st_luke>\"If it can't be used for piracy, it isn't decentralized enough.\"\n19:29:04<ralphtheninja>it also has to be easy to adopt, it must not require installation of some vm or extra

and peers.join?\n19:30:51<jjjjohnnny>there is a ready userbase of encrypted, optionally anonymous p2p\n19:31:20<jjjjohnnny>secrets leakers and journalists\n19:31:35<jjjjohnnny>anarchists\n19:31:47<jjjjohnnny>protestors\n19:32:05<jjjjohnnny>true p2p is not an application, its a protocol\n19:32:14<dominictarr>so, a social network for enemies of the state.\n19:33:36<jjjjohnnny>once there is established a way to post, search, download and decrypt data to a public p2p network, it will get used just like the regular web\n19:33:46<ralphtheninja>at least a social network for people with similar ideas and values that treasure anonymity\n19:34:05<dominictarr>of course, there is TOR\n19:34:31<dominictarr>the people involved need a good way to communicate, and collaborate.\n19:34:39<dominictarr>for it to grow\n19:34:39<ralphtheninja>aye\n19:34:45<jjjjohnnny>social networks are applications, built on top\n19:34:51<ralphtheninja>tor is great, but still too nerdy for the 'average person'\n19:35:23<jjjjohnnny>if the protestors want a social network for staying updated on locations, police activities, etc, that is built ON TOP of the p2p encrypto net\n19:35:39<ralphtheninja>same with e.g. bitcoins, people just don't get it\n19:36:05<jjjjohnnny>what the user doesn't need to know is that their use of the protocol is what make it work\n19:36:14<ralphtheninja>jjjjohnnny: yeah you're right\n19:36:25<jjjjohnnny>because they host fragments of encrypted data\n19:36:38<dominictarr>so, we've gotta get people building distributed systems first\n19:37:08<ralphtheninja>aye, a general protocol for sharing any type of data, and build apps on top of that\n19:37:09<dominictarr>then they will understand how to build p2p\n19:37:11<jjjjohnnny>which may not even be germain to their use of it\n19:38:16<jjjjohnnny>dominictarr: no we need to build the basic protocol for p2p connection and hosting of encrypted data, how to search for it (hashes) and collect the fragments\n19:38:57<jjjjohnnny>an enrypted file becomes a qr code or a new kind of link\n19:39:10<ralphtheninja>sounds like freenet\n19:40:41<jjjjohnnny>its not unlike bit torrent\n19:41:11<dominictarr>also, just figure out how to build applications that work distributed and eventually consistent.\n19:41:12<jjjjohnnny>except that users don't know what file fragments they are hosting\n19:42:13<dominictarr>that is one approach\n19:42:30<jjjjohnnny>true it is only one\n19:42:51<jjjjohnnny>but it goes straight for a p2p hostes network\n19:42:52<jjjjohnnny>hosted\n19:42:53<dominictarr>but if I've learned one thing from observing/using/working on a bunch of crappy systems,\n19:43:07<dominictarr>it's that you are tightly coupled to your persistence\n19:43:17<dominictarr>and you need to choose the right pattern\n19:43:56<dominictarr>it's not something you can successfully abstract away, except for a given class of applications.\n19:44:25<jjjjohnnny>my feeling is that persistence is got through replication\n19:44:56<jjjjohnnny>and that perhaps persistence is not gauranteed after some ammount of time\n19:45:25<jjjjohnnny>like if I post my location to the public p2p cryptograph, it should be available for a while\n19:45:36<ralphtheninja>I dont think that the data have to be encrypted and split up into fragments, might as well just store it unencrypted locally and share with your trusted peers\n19:45:56<jjjjohnnny>ralphtheninja: that is a second layer\n19:46:04* tilgovijoined\n19:46:22* defunctzombiequit\n19:46:24<jjjjohnnny>ralphtheninja: the first layer should be a publicly available network of encryption and anonymous use\n19:46:55* defunctzombiejoined\n19:47:17<jjjjohnnny>which is the protocol\n19:47:34* zz_shykeschanged nick to shykes\n19:47:55<jjjjohnnny>if you want a trust network you can trade public keys or just built your own network using the same protocol\n19:47:56<ralphtheninja>totally with you there\n19:48:11* defunctzombiechanged nick to shtylman\n19:49:14<ralphtheninja>so the first layer is basically just taking care of the infrastructure, how nodes communicate etc?\n19:50:03<jjjjohnnny>the reason i suggest a public net of encrypted fragments (replicated across multiple nodes) is so that people can't be caught hosting files, even tho it necessary that they do for the network to exist\n19:51:19* shtylmanchanged nick to defunctzombie\n19:51:24<jjjjohnnny>ralphtheninja: yes, and how to locate files (similar to bit torrent), upload files, etc\n19:51:25* defunctzombiequit (Client Quit)\n19:51:44* defunctzombiejoined\n19:52:38<jjjjohnnny>from a user perspective, they should get a link, and their cryptograph application should know how to find that file on the public net (if it still exists)\n19:53:10<jjjjohnnny>or whatever the application does for them\n19:53:31* AvianFluquit (Remote host closed the connection)\n19:53:51<jjjjohnnny>Raynos: this is why we need true p2p in node, so that any kind of decentralized p2p app of this kind can be built\n19:54:13<ralphtheninja>yeah it's a good idea, but it will mean an extra overhead, might slow the network down\n19:55:06<jjjjohnnny>ralphtheninja: thats a tradeoff. but if designed well, a popular in a certain area (or among an ad hoc network) should be highly available\n19:55:12<jjjjohnnny>a popular file**\n19:56:08<ralphtheninja>I really like the idea of splitting data into fragments\n19:57:21<ralphtheninja>I'm a p2p n00b really, have too little basic knowledge, but it's fascinating and I think it's the future\n19:58:11<jjjjohnnny>if the user wants to save the file after downloading it from around the network, they can, just as we do in browsers\n19:58:56<jjjjohnnny>but for many applications, the data is time sensitive\n19:59:16<rowbit>Hourly usage stats: [developer: 3, free: 49]\n20:00:06<jjjjohnnny>i have made some

ROMANCE.\n20:01:50<jjjjohnnny>we need laws that say \"NATS HAVE to give you A PUBLIC IPV6 ADDRESS! GRAWRR!!\"\n20:02:21<ralphtheninja>should be possible to just gossip between nodes of where data is located, eventually your node knows there the file is\n20:02:35<jjjjohnnny>ok laws wont work but i dont know how else to push that\n20:02:37<ralphtheninja>query through gossip\n20:02:56<ralphtheninja>knows where*\n20:03:17<jjjjohnnny>yeah thats DHT stuff of which I am totally ignorant\n20:04:30<jjjjohnnny>i think dominictarr is hard at work on that\n20:05:22<dominictarr>I'm currently at work on the stuff for more targeted replication\n20:05:44<dominictarr>like replication between your twitter friends\n20:06:10<dominictarr>but this is the layer that massive anon DHT could be constructed effectively\n20:06:25<dominictarr>and also, that useful apps could be built on\n20:08:19<jjjjohnnny>its cool that we can prototype this technology on games and fun apps\n20:08:21<ralphtheninja>however, I think the protocol must be open and tech agnostic, obviously we'd implement it with node, but if others communities want to implement it in another enviroment that should be grand\n20:09:00<mbalho>http://telehash.org/ i know the author of this\n20:09:28<jjjjohnnny>my secret goal is to raise a bunch of money to create games that will push this technology up and out\n20:10:02<mbalho>jjjjohnnny: thats not too far fetched honestly\n20:10:04<st_luke>gonna try out leveldb in a work project\n20:10:09<st_luke>was building couch then I realized I just didn't need that much\n20:10:19<jjjjohnnny>mbalho: yeah i have always wanted to know how to effectively use telehash\n20:10:27<mbalho>well its still kidna vaporware\n20:10:34<mbalho>but i like the protocol\n20:10:49<mbalho>i think we should implement it\n20:10:52<dominictarr>jjjjohnnny, good plan\n20:11:02<jjjjohnnny>mbalho: yeah i mean push the development internally, while we make games for fun and profit\n20:12:16<jjjjohnnny>oh telehash is vaporware. I asked him about it and he kind gave me the look that said it might not be used as advertised, i dunno\n20:14:16<jjjjohnnny>if he wants to come out and tell us how to use it ...\n20:14:25* tomshredsjoined\n20:14:40<mbalho>its not too difficult to understand\n20:15:03<mbalho>there are partial implementations but the reason i say its vaporware is because nobody is really driving development\n20:15:06<mbalho>making it production level\n20:17:18<dominictarr>mbalho, what does it do, basically?\n20:17:38<ralphtheninja>mbalho: implementing it is a great idea\n20:18:10<ralphtheninja>and it's udp as well, rock n roll\n20:18:35<mbalho>http://telehash.org/proto.html\n20:19:31<mbalho>core part is: . Every Switch maintains a list of it's neighbors, some further from that, and a few from very far away\n20:20:06<mbalho>basically it gives you p2p message routing\n20:20:57<dominictarr>right, so it makes it easy to send p2p messages\n20:21:05<dominictarr>it handles the nat busting etc\n20:22:12<ralphtheninja>dominictarr, what's nat busting?\n20:22:52<dominictarr>it's about sending messages direct to machines that don't have their own IP\n20:23:16* TylerGilliesjoined\n20:23:20<dominictarr>because they are behind a router, or firewall\n20:23:26<ralphtheninja>check\n20:23:27<mbalho>i found this article once but have since lost it that explains how most routers open ports on outgoing pings and wait for the response to come back through the same port\n20:23:34<TylerGillies>yo dawg i herd you like browsers\n20:23:45<mbalho>so if you only send an outgoing ping and tell someone else to send data to you back through the same port the router will let it through\n20:23:53<mbalho>TylerGillies: have you implemented nat busting in telehash\n20:24:00<TylerGillies>yeah\n20:24:09<TylerGillies>nat busting is interesting\n20:24:19<TylerGillies>especially on airport routers\n20:24:24<TylerGillies>since they use port randomization\n20:24:33<TylerGillies>so traditional nat doesn't work very well\n20:24:38<TylerGillies>nat busting rather\n20:25:02<mbalho>jeremie miller told me about weird tcp over udp spec\n20:25:08<mbalho>some weird*\n20:25:13<mbalho>from a couple of years ago\n20:25:33<TylerGillies>theres a few things that hack tc over udp\n20:25:45<TylerGillies>theres an article on busting nat with tcp and not needing to use udp\n20:26:36<jjjjohnnny>I followed the supposed methodology of that and failed\n20:26:54<TylerGillies>jjjjohnnny: me too, but i am have airport router so not surprising in my case\n20:27:01<TylerGillies>i have*\n20:27:16<jjjjohnnny>oh by airport you mean wifi?\n20:27:35<TylerGillies>jjjjohnnny: i mean the router, which has wifi ability\n20:27:36<mbalho>http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/\n20:28:04<TylerGillies>they use NAT-PMP\n20:28:16<TylerGillies>which is a proprietary apple protocol\n20:28:47<TylerGillies>i wrote a script for nat punching it in like 3 lines of code though\n20:29:11<dominictarr>interesting\n20:29:12<jjjjohnnny>I could find no correlation between what port i listen on with my local net.Server and the outermost NAT port, though I could predict the latter\n20:29:34<dominictarr>you have a port per socket, right?\n20:29:51<dominictarr>like, outgoing connections get assigned a port?\n20:29:56<mbalho>TylerGillies: we are currently working on distributed systems in node\n20:30:00<mbalho>(generally)\n20:30:06<jjjjohnnny>yes, on your machine, your ruoter, and the ISP NAT itself\n20:30:43<TylerGillies>mbalho: if the network has known peers you could use hamachi and not have to worry about nat\n20:30:48<jjjjohnnny>but when is set my local to listen on a port it has no correlation to the port my NAT is going to set\n20:31:02* shuaibquit (Quit: Textual IRC Client: http://www.textualapp.com/)\n20:31:25<jjjjohnnny>so even tho i can predict that NATs port (which was sequential), i could not poke through down to my local\n20:31:29<TylerGillies>mbalho: or tell people to install hamachi and join a public network, i have one setup at pdxtech with password pdxtech\n20:31:54<mbalho>TylerGillies: thats too nerdy tho\n20:32:13<jjjjohnnny>i'll try UDP later, hopefully it will work as the internet says, cuz it doesn't sound hard. but tcp was a bust.\n20:32:35<TylerGillies>the only way to do good nat is have a list of nat breaking techniques and have the app go through them until it has success\n20:32:43<TylerGillies>thats what most p2p apps do like bit torrent clients\n20:33:20<mbalho>like socket.io but for nat\n20:33:29<TylerGillies>nat.io\n20:33:34<mbalho>nattydread\n20:33:38<mbalho>nattyreed\n20:34:45<ralphtheninja>I like nattydread :)\n20:41:30<TylerGillies>theres also the localtunnel

was gonna say that is a dumb question, then realized it was you asking and that you know more about such things than me :)\n21:03:41<chrisdickinson>haha\n21:03:44* ITproquit (Ping timeout: 276

one... hold on\n21:04:25<mbalho>npmjs.org/CSSOM\n21:04:31<mbalho>might do what you want\n21:05:29<dominictarr>I've gotta say, I havn't met anyone who i'd consider a huge douche in the nodejs community\n21:06:04<mbalho>thats a good point\n21:06:40<mbalho>the people who use node and are huge douches tend to not participate in community events for whatever reason\n21:06:44<jjjjohnnny>but if you were a rubyhead your opinion would be different (because nodesters would stick their toungue out at you)\n21:07:02<mbalho>i have met many huge rails douches\n21:07:32<st_luke>the node community is too small for people to be jerks without getting called out on their shit\n21:08:02<jjjjohnnny>im amazed that nodejs is still a fringe group\n21:08:25<mbalho>most programming 'communities' are fringe\n21:08:40<jjjjohnnny>even the technology is fringe\n21:09:19<jjjjohnnny>the trajectory is obvious tho\n21:09:22<chrisdickinson>cssom looks close, but what i'm looking for is something like https://gist.github.com/a05f3ce9ef8573094062\n21:09:50<mbalho>chrisdickinson: why not convert your thing to css first\n21:09:54<chrisdickinson>so you can use css selectors to match arbitrary data structures\n21:10:11<mbalho>oh sounds like jsonquery\n21:10:11<jjjjohnnny>and use javascritp to append css\n21:10:23<jjjjohnnny>and write css strings in javascritp\n21:10:26<dominictarr>I am somehow especially good at avoiding interpersonal dramas, I think it might be because I never repeat things one person says to a third person.\n21:10:41<dominictarr>if it was in any way personal\n21:11:00<jjjjohnnny>dominictarr: but... thats what gossis IS\n21:11:06<jjjjohnnny>gossip\n21:11:08<mbalho>dominictarr: your embedded hardware has DRM\n21:11:25<dominictarr>yeah, so I don't do gossip\n21:11:35<chrisdickinson>(you could use that proposed api for the dom, but you could also use it for AST trees)\n21:11:39<chrisdickinson>just double checking before i write it\n21:11:48<mbalho>chrisdickinson: there was a thing that i think was called json query\n21:11:52<mbalho>chrisdickinson: dont remember the exact name\n21:12:00<st_luke>dominictarr: that's a good personal policy\n21:12:12<jjjjohnnny>there is a jsonpath like xpath\n21:12:22<dominictarr>jjjjohnnny, yes several\n21:12:41<jjjjohnnny>i dont use them just sayin\n21:13:04* ITprojoined\n21:13:33<jjjjohnnny>its cool that leveldb keys can be any data structure but I wonder whats the use?\n21:13:57<dominictarr>just use https://github.com/substack/node-pathway\n21:14:14<dominictarr>jjjjohnnny, no, only strings.\n21:14:21<dominictarr>or buffers rather\n21:14:52<rvagg>buffers of anything\n21:15:23<rvagg>dominictarr: I ran into that problem of writeStream() not passing on options to put/batch yesterday, needed a sync:true but had to queue a separate operation at the end just to get it... I think that needs fixing\n21:15:50* defunctzombiequit (Changing host)\n21:15:51* defunctzombiejoined\n21:16:01<dominictarr>rvagg, what does sync: true do?\n21:16:14<dominictarr>does it do the request synchronously?\n21:16:22<rvagg>no, it does a sync fs operation\n21:16:37<rvagg>otherwise it just hands off the data to the OS and the data is written whenever the OS can be bothered\n21:17:08<rvagg>so if you write large chunks of data and then turn around and request them back really quickly, without a sync to force a flush to the fs you won't get it back!\n21:17:51<juliangruber>I thought that couldn't happen\n21:17:54<rvagg>it's much slower to write to the fs but it's a little like guaranteed consistency when you're doing multi-thread access like in node\n21:17:57<juliangruber>leveldb is smarter then that\n21:18:09<rvagg>not if you're accessing via multiple threads juliangruber\n21:18:37<juliangruber>i thought that were only for the case of failure\n21:18:44<juliangruber>and that leveldb keeps things in memory\n21:18:46<juliangruber>hm\n21:19:21<rvagg>if you want to see it in action, you can try it out with this: https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup/blob/master/test/functional/binary-data-test.js#L27\n21:19:30<dominictarr>rvagg, oh, got it.\n21:19:58<rvagg>comment that out and you won't see all of the data come back out that you just pushed in.. generally only shows up if you're putting in large chunks, small chunks seem to flush quickly enough\n21:20:08<juliangruber>oh ok\n21:20:12<juliangruber>good to know :)\n21:20:47<dominictarr>rvagg, but node only uses a single thread. but you still need sync:true?\n21:20:57<rvagg>it'd be nice to have a flush() actually... but I'm not sure how to do that without writing arbitrary data and then deleting it again--potentially conflicting with existing keys, though I suppose a get() could check first..\n21:21:12<juliangruber>dominictarr a single process?\n21:21:16<dominictarr>yes\n21:21:20<rvagg>dominictarr: no, you'll have multiple worker threads accessing the database for async\n21:21:22<TylerGillies>i should implement the ycombinator in javascript\n21:21:33<TylerGillies>i did it in ruby to get anonymous recursive procs\n21:22:00<juliangruber>rvagg put(_________________________________2)\n21:22:02<juliangruber>or so\n21:22:13<juliangruber>or random with the get\n21:22:24<dominictarr>rvagg, is that because the binding is sync?\n21:22:30<juliangruber>but the use case would have to show where that's necessary\n21:22:30<TylerGillies>http://amix.dk/blog/post/19239\n21:22:35<rvagg>put(+new Date + '____________' + Math.random() + process.pid)\n21:22:37<TylerGillies>someone beat me to it\n21:23:02<juliangruber>dominictarr: multiple js threads can access leveldb at the same time, leveldb is threadsafe\n21:23:12<juliangruber>in most cases\n21:23:20<mbalho>it has a process lock\n21:23:25<mbalho>1 process at a time\n21:23:30<juliangruber>yup\n21:23:36<rvagg>dominictarr: no, the binding is totally async, it doesn't restrict which worker threads can access the leveldb core so it just lets libuv go at it, do many operations at once and you'll have multiple libuv worker threads hammering away\n21:23:56<dominictarr>oh\n21:23:58<dominictarr>okay\n21:23:59<juliangruber>leveldb is designed so well\n21:24:09<dominictarr>what do you need worker threads for though?\n21:24:21<juliangruber>because it's async?\n21:24:28<juliangruber>uv_queue_work\n21:24:31<rvagg>libuv's worker threads\n21:24:37<rvagg>not just one thread\n21:25:27<dominictarr>rvagg, so does a put callback before it's on actually on disk?\n21:25:35<rvagg>yes\n21:25:43* rvaggfinds the docs\n21:25:52<mbalho>juliangruber: were you the guy on twitter the other day who said you wouldnt use the stream api for performance reasons\n21:26:03<rvagg>dominictarr: read about Synchronous Writes at http://leveldb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/index.html\n21:26:26<rvagg>interesting, the summary is: sync:true = slow but safe, sync:false = fast and generally safe enough\n21:26:27<dominictarr>right, so if I want durability you must set sync:true\n21:26:29<juliangruber>mbalho: yes, in certain cases\n21:26:45<rvagg>dominictarr: you can gate with a single sync:true if you want and all previous writes will be flushed too\n21:26:58<dominictarr>rvagg, okay interesting.\n21:27:00<rvagg>so many sync:false and end with a single sync:true and you'll get more speed\n21:27:09<mbalho>juliangruber: you should still use the api so that it has plumbing with other modules but realize you dont have to emit data in a 1 record:1 emit fashion, you can batch all you want\n21:27:29<dominictarr>I'm hooking into puts, and turning them into batches, and also writing a TODO for the map-reduce jobs,\n21:27:35<rvagg>yay, lets have a streams argument again....\n21:27:43<mbalho>(i missed the first one)\n21:27:47<rvagg>dominictarr: sync:true on a batch is probably a good idea if you care enough about consistency\n21:28:01<mbalho>but not using streams for perf reasons sounds like a misinformed argument to me is all\n21:28:12<dominictarr>so if the process crashes, then you restart the map-reduce and your reduce will be correct\n21:28:13<rvagg>dominictarr: see last para in that Synchronous Writes section in the docs\n21:28:16<juliangruber>dominictarr: https://github.com/juliangruber/node-leveled/blob/middleware/lib/middleware/queue.js\n21:28:22<dominictarr>while still being incremental\n21:28:54<rvagg>sorry, gotta disappear for a while\n21:29:17<juliangruber>mbalho: you mean using a stream just for the api and only emitting one data event?\n21:29:51<dominictarr>juliangruber, I am talking about a durable queue\n21:30:09<dominictarr>it still works across crashes\n21:30:29<mbalho>juliangruber: i mean using the stream for the api and emitting data events as you see fit, if that means only one data event then sure, but it seems like imposing buffering constraints is too rigid\n21:30:51<juliangruber>dominictarrr: I thought you'd do that for performance. A durable queue would be nice\n21:30:52<mbalho>getting data sooner vs paying the inter process cost should be configurable\n21:31:28<juliangruber>mbalho: yeah making it configurable seems the way to go. for the queries i need leveldb to do everyting streaming was way slower\n21:31:49<dominictarr>juliangruber, yes your one looks good for perf\n21:32:22<dominictarr>the great thing about leveldb is that we get to implement all the high level features in js\n21:32:37<dominictarr>so we can easily add whatever we need\n21:32:46<juliangruber>mbalho: I often need like 25.000 rows at once and so far, without any production load, buffering is the way to go\n21:33:06<juliangruber>dominictarr: yes, leveldb is perfect for that\n21:33:22<mbalho>juliangruber: how long does it take for the callback to fire on those 25000 rows and then what do you do with them\n21:33:38<juliangruber>still, things like my range()/find() which are implemented in c make certain things waaaay faster. If you need that\n21:33:46<juliangruber>mbalho: 50ms\n21:34:08<TylerGillies>woo, hackin on nodejs code in my java editor\n21:34:49<juliangruber>mbalho: Push those rows do the client and then send updates\n21:35:04<juliangruber>so I'll implemented a stream for that of course\n21:35:45<mbalho>i guess as long as your query result size < available RAM it doesnt matter\n21:36:01<juliangruber>I just don't want my binding to have much js stuff in it, it should be just c with everything implemented that you need c to do\n21:36:09<mbalho>would be interesting to see concurrency benchmarks with big queries though\n21:36:24<juliangruber>tested with siege and times are constant\n21:36:44<juliangruber>but will have to test with more realistic load levels and see how mem usage etc. go\n21:37:05<ralphtheninja>reading up on streams in node right now, should I stick with 0.8 streams or jump straight onto streams2 like Raynos have? what's your thoughts on this?\n21:37:53<juliangruber>ralphtheninja: check out through by dominictarr\n21:38:17<juliangruber>that helps a lot if just experimenting with one way streams\n21:38:58<juliangruber>and it's api should be quite stable ;)\n21:39:26<dominictarr>juliangruber, mbalho if you had to send the results over the network, then absolutely, you'd stream\n21:39:41<dominictarr>streams are fast because you can go slow\n21:39:51<dominictarr>they are lazy\n21:40:02<ralphtheninja>juliangruber: thanks, but my question is more if I should invest time on 0.8 streams or 0.10\n21:40:23<mbalho>ralphtheninja: its backwards compatible so dont worry too much\n21:40:40<dominictarr>you'll get more help if you do 0.8.\n21:40:49<dominictarr>0.10 is still in development\n21:41:09<dominictarr>is it even rolled into 0.9 yet?\n21:41:18<ralphtheninja>will it be a lot of work converting current 0.8 implementations to the new spec later on?\n21:41:27<ralphtheninja>I dunno, it's on npm though\n21:41:51<ralphtheninja>aah screw it, guess I'll go with current streams for now\n21:45:13<dominictarr>the incidental surface details are different, but their *meaning* is basically the same.\n21:45:42<dominictarr>once you understand what the events and methods *mean* then I don't think it will be too hard.\n21:47:59<Raynos>ralphtheninja; there are bugs in readable-stream\n21:48:06<Raynos>I use 0.10 because I'm nice and help isaacs find the bugs\n21:48:10<Raynos>that's the only reason.\n21:52:21<Raynos>also interop between 0.8 and 0.10 streams is a pain in the ass.\n21:52:26<Raynos>i advice you to just use 0.8\n21:59:16<rowbit>Hourly usage stats: [developer: 6, free: 29]\n22:01:59<juliangruber>docminictarr: been reading conferences.sigcomm.org/co-next/2009/papers/Jacobson.pdf , it might turn into a npm module at the example of scuttlebutt :)\n22:02:58<jesusabdullah>dominictarr: ls-r has no readme :'(\n22:03:02<jesusabdullah>dominictarr: :'(\n22:03:22<jesusabdullah>dominictarr: I don't have TIME to read the source! *indignance*\n22:07:49<fotoverite>Hows Alaska Jesusabdullah?\n22:14:25* shykeschanged nick to zz_shykes\n22:19:54* _sorensenquit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)\n22:30:03<jesusabdullah>fotoverite: most excellent.\n22:30:10<jesusabdullah>fotoverite: a little chilly of course\n22:34:11<jesusabdullah>fotoverite: was seriously missing the AK coffee scene\n22:35:20* defunctzombiequit (Remote host closed the connection)\n22:48:06* zz_shykeschanged nick to shykes\n22:50:24<substack>jesusabdullah: there's a coffee scene up in towel-keetna?\n22:56:13<fotoverite>Something gotta keep them warm.\n22:56:14* jibayjoined\n22:56:30<fotoverite>I might ned to start a coffee hack group like Max is doing.

way\n01:03:49<Raynos>to replicate leveldb\n01:05:37<ralphtheninja>substack: safe travels\n01:06:50<dominictarr>Raynos, there is an example in the readme, but it's only master slave\n01:07:02<Raynos>really\n01:07:02<dominictarr>it depends on what sort of data you are using.\n01:07:24<dominictarr>you just db.readStream().pipe(db.writeStream())\n01:07:28<Raynos>which readme\n01:07:32<dominictarr>levelup\n01:07:43<Raynos>oh thats copy\n01:07:45<Raynos>not replicate :P\n01:08:07<dominictarr>so, the next most simple way, would be to use a scuttlebutt pattern\n01:08:31<Raynos>replicate to me means synchronizing two ranges\n01:08:36<dominictarr>we could hook that up pretty easy with the stuff I've been working on\n01:08:56<Raynos>what about just sending the entire range\n01:08:57<Raynos>from both ends\n01:09:01<Raynos>and calling merge(a, b)\n01:09:02<Raynos>for each one\n01:09:07<dominictarr>that would work\n01:09:17<Raynos>with an optional handshake up front\n01:09:20<Raynos>to not send entire range\n01:09:24<Raynos>but only different values\n01:10:09<Raynos>stream.pipe(replicate(db, { start, end }).pipe(stream)\n01:10:17<dominictarr>I have an test in map-reduce that writes a update log\n01:10:53<dominictarr>would be cool to use different replication strageties for different key ranges\n01:11:24<Raynos>yeah\n01:11:44<Raynos>replicate(db, { start, end, merge, headshakeStrategy })\n01:12:12<Raynos>maybe also options\n01:12:14<Raynos>to read and write\n01:12:17<Raynos>so you can say\n01:12:30<Raynos>replicate(db, { read }).pipe(replicate(db, { write })\n01:12:49<Raynos>aw man\n01:13:02<Raynos>db.use(function (db) {\n01:13:03<Raynos> db.replicate = function () { ... }\n01:13:03<Raynos>})\n01:17:12<dominictarr>Raynos, the data is a global scope inside the db, with potential collisions, so having separate functions and shit on the outside doesn't help much\n01:17:33<Raynos>seperate functions are clean\n01:17:36<Raynos>because they are functions\n01:17:40<Raynos>and they export one thing\n01:18:03<dominictarr>but they have side effects\n01:18:06<dominictarr>on the database\n01:18:08<Raynos>I prefer the seperate function as a style choice\n01:18:12<dominictarr>so they arn't clean\n01:18:36<Raynos>its less magic\n01:18:40<Raynos>then something monkey patching the db\n01:18:42<dominictarr>this way reflects the underlying nature of the database\n01:18:53<Raynos>its simply cleaner api wise\n01:19:20<Raynos>db.use(replication) db.replicate(...) vs replicate(db, ...)\n01:19:25<Raynos>less bullshi\n01:20:19<dominictarr>if the database had internal closuers, I would do it that way\n01:21:29<dominictarr>you are sticking to a principle too strictly, I'm breaking the rules because I understand their purpose.\n01:22:15* st_lukequit\n01:22:56<Raynos>its not that im stickign too it too strictly\n01:23:03<Raynos>its that im saying one function call is simpler api wise then two\n01:23:12<Raynos>i dont see the benefit to the middleware pattern in this case\n01:27:16<dominictarr>well, nothing is set is stone yet\n01:28:35<ralphtheninja>can I use shoe to connect to a websocket on another site?\n01:28:52* AvianFlujoined\n01:29:05<Raynos>dominictarr: that was a genuine question of why are you breaking the rule. whats the benefit. whats the point\n01:29:34<Raynos>ralphtheninja: yes.\n01:30:23<ralphtheninja>var sock = shoe('www.somesite.com/namespace') ?\n01:30:52<Raynos>yes\n01:31:05<ralphtheninja>eeeexcellent *rubs hands like Mr Burns*\n01:31:08<Raynos>like var sock = shoe(\"//signalchannel.co/sock\")\n01:31:38<dominictarr>Raynos, mainly, because the plugins must mutate the db inside, anyway\n01:32:01<dominictarr>so you need to know if you are, say, already queuing stuff in this database\n01:32:18<Raynos>just patch the db parameter in your function\n01:32:19<dominictarr>so, you should mutate it on the outside too\n01:32:47<dominictarr>you'd need to leave a mark on the db object, so the next time it's called you know what is up\n01:32:59<Raynos>thats fine\n01:33:07<dominictarr>or you'd have to track all these extra queue objects\n01:33:07<Raynos>or you use a weakmap\n01:33:10<dominictarr>and stuff\n01:33:27<dominictarr>weak map won't work in the browser\n01:33:40<Raynos>require(\"weakmap\")\n01:33:41<Raynos>done.\n01:33:50<dominictarr>in the browser?\n01:33:56<Raynos>yes\n01:34:05<Raynos>its has the weakmap garbage semantics\n01:34:13<Raynos>its just not as efficient as a native weakmap\n01:34:23<dominictarr>but does it actually work?\n01:34:29<Raynos>yes.\n01:34:32<dominictarr>okay,\n01:34:34<dominictarr>but anyway,\n01:34:35<Raynos>it may not work on host objects\n01:34:51<Raynos>I agree you have to mutate the db somehow\n01:35:05<dominictarr>you'd also need to use the right objects, like map-reduce uses a queue and some hooks\n01:35:23<dominictarr>so if you tried to add more queues there is the potential of collisions\n01:36:14<dominictarr>you need the queue to know that there is a queue there already, and add to that instead.\n01:36:22<Raynos>oh\n01:36:27<Raynos>so its a shared queue\n01:36:32<Raynos>just between map-reduce\n01:36:35<Raynos>or other modules too?\n01:37:05<Raynos>var queue = map.get(db)\n01:37:05<Raynos>if (!queue) { queue = Queue() map.set(db, queue) }\n01:37:30<Raynos>alternatively\n01:37:37<Raynos>mapreduce = MapReduce(db); mapreduce(...)\n01:37:52<Raynos>now if you had a thing where you wanted to use the same queue\n01:37:57<Raynos>between multiple \"leveldb plugins\"\n01:38:02<Raynos>then yes .use is the right thing\n01:38:18<Raynos>and you instruct your user to .use(queue).use(mapreduce)\n01:40:05<dominictarr>Raynos, other modules too\n01:40:31<Raynos>how would you co-ordinate it other then tell the user \"apply the queue before mapreduce and X\"\n01:40:40<Raynos>oh I know\n01:40:52<dominictarr>correct. that is basically how it has to be,\n01:40:55<Raynos>function mapReduce(db) { var queue = require(\"queue/get\")(db) ... }\n01:41:04<Raynos>queue keeps an internal weakmap\n01:41:14<Raynos>and map reduce has dependency on queue and asks queue to fetch a queue for the db\n01:41:27<Raynos>now you dont need to care about it and X can use the same queue module with the same weakmap\n01:41:28* tphummeljoined\n01:41:33<Raynos>except you have npm dedup issues now :/\n01:41:39<Raynos>thats ok\n01:41:44<Raynos>use an Raynos/individual\n01:42:10<Raynos>but thats just as ugly as .use(queue).use(mapReduce)\n01:42:11<dominictarr>I feel like weakmaps are more magic than the way I'm doing it.\n01:42:21<Raynos>except the uglyness is pushed into the implementation\n01:42:56<dominictarr>yes, and I want it to be easy to implement additional plugins\n01:43:14<Raynos>implementing additional plugins is easy. Write functions\n01:43:29<Raynos>if two plugins need access to shared state they should both require the same module and that module should encapsulate shared state\n01:43:41<Raynos>alternatively the user bolts the shared state onto db up front\n01:43:43<Raynos>in the right order\n01:44:09<Raynos>i would prefer the weakmap approach as the user api surface is far cleaner\n01:45:31<dominictarr>can you post an example of how you use weakmaps?\n01:45:39<dominictarr>I'm not really familiar with them\n01:46:32<Raynos>https://github.com/Colingo/data-set/blob/master/index.js#L7\n01:46:41<Raynos>name

If you want the source option added just assign an issue to me with that and I will do it tonight. As for the cache, if after the detective changes you still think it is a worthwhile benefit I am not against it\n19:10:18<substack>ok sweet!\n19:10:31<substack>yes I will mill over the detective changes\n19:10:39<substack>I think perhaps a streaming interface would work best too\n19:10:48<substack>to avoid buffering all the files in memory\n19:11:03<substack>and to allow immediate streaming processing\n19:11:17<defunctzombie>that would be challenging with the current use of esprima\n19:11:18<substack>which is especially important for cpu-bound plugins like transpilers\n19:11:29<substack>the file reads don't need to be streaming\n19:11:39<substack>just every fs.readFile, emit a 'data' event\n19:11:45<defunctzombie>as for streaming for required, the major thing to consider is how that translates to the tree data currently in place\n19:11:56<substack>oh true\n19:12:10<substack>I'm basically just reconstructing the cache data structure for browserify\n19:12:16<substack>it works much better to have a flat structure\n19:12:26<substack>so I'm flattening everything\n19:12:31<substack>I'll push my v2 branch\n19:12:43<defunctzombie>I flatten in script, but that happens outside of required\n19:12:53<defunctzombie>once the full information is known to be able to flatten\n19:13:09<substack>but cache is already flattened\n19:13:09<defunctzombie>I mean.. basically we are talking about a map/reduce of sorts :/\n19:13:22<substack>just a key/value with file => ref\n19:14:23<substack>https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/blob/v2.0/index.js#L40\n19:14:26<defunctzombie>yea, which might be why it is possible to get away with just specifying the parent file\n19:14:35<defunctzombie>if a streaming like interface is desired\n19:15:13<substack>oh I have an idea!\n19:15:22<substack>so keep the regular callback api as-is\n19:15:25<substack>but return a stream\n19:15:37<substack>a stream that emits the source files with the dependency data\n19:15:42<substack>the stream is flat, the callback is nested\n19:15:46<defunctzombie>fascinating\n19:16:01<substack>I'll look into this approach\n19:16:05<defunctzombie>var stream = required('/some/file');\n19:16:13<defunctzombie>so if there is no callback it will just do it with the stream\n19:16:18<defunctzombie>yea, I could see this working\n19:16:29* yorickjoined\n19:16:29* yorickquit (Changing host)\n19:16:29* yorickjoined\n19:16:30<substack>well it could return a stream in either case\n19:16:30<defunctzombie>the only thing is that when you emit a source file\n19:16:34<defunctzombie>yes\n19:16:49<defunctzombie>if you emit a source file tho you don't have the dependency data for it yet\n19:16:52<substack>and it can emit the source files so it doesn't need to keep all the source files in memory while compiling\n19:17:28<substack>you don't have the nested dependency data but I'm only converting to the first-order dependencies anyways\n19:17:35<defunctzombie>unless you emit backwards, but then backwards you lose the in memory thing\n19:17:52<substack>https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/blob/v2.0/index.js#L67-L70\n19:18:27<substack>the callback can return the complete graph, the stream events can return the immediate dependencies\n19:18:40<defunctzombie>does that take into account require('a\") within two separate modules possibly leading to two separate files?\n19:18:55<defunctzombie>because that can happen\n19:19:05<substack>yes it's keyed on the filename\n19:19:06<substack>not the id\n19:19:08<defunctzombie>k\n19:19:36<substack>oh also if required() returns a stream it could have a method require() to load another file and to use the same cache\n19:19:55<substack>this is important because browserify bundles can have multiple entry points and explit requires\n19:20:11<defunctzombie>sure\n19:20:45<substack>required(file, cb) could just be sugar for `var r = required(); r.require(file, cb); return r`\n19:20:58<defunctzombie>I will think on it as well, one thing I will note is that it may not be all that much of a gain in the end. the amount of information we are talking about loading into memory is very small :)\n19:21:00<substack>in which case you can ignore my cache PR\n19:21:35<substack>I have some gigantic production bundles I can test this against\n19:21:42<defunctzombie>good :)\n19:21:52<defunctzombie>try removing the range: true from detective\n19:21:55<substack>when you use a lot of modules from npm with a lot of dependencies, this stuff can get pretty big\n19:21:56<defunctzombie>and starting from there\n19:21:59<substack>right\n19:22:45<defunctzombie>holding text files in memory is not the real killer here :) but the streaming interface could lead to something interesting\n19:23:25<substack>also at some point I'd like to take a stab at forking esprima to be streaming\n19:24:02<defunctzombie>that sounds more challenging.. cause again, you have the tree like structure\n19:24:17<substack>actually the code is written in such a way that it shouldn't be very complicated\n19:24:30<substack>the get() function to grab the next token is already abstracted out\n19:24:37<substack>it's just sync when it needs to be async for streaming\n19:25:32<defunctzombie>I don't see how it benefits from streaming as it is single file based\n19:25:36<defunctzombie>and all cpu bound\n19:26:04<defunctzombie>there is no IO within esprima iirc\n19:26:41<substack>incremental processing\n19:27:22* defunctzombiequit (Remote host closed the

It sucks having so many\n22:18:23<dominictarr>yeah, the other difficult place is batch operations\n22:18:29<dominictarr>you have a chaining interface\n22:19:06<dominictarr>but levelup passes an array\n22:20:02<dominictarr>leveldb is a good starting place for kv store. it's the lowest common denomenator of databases.\n22:20:08<juliangruber>perhaps a wrapper lib that lets you use different kv stores through an standardized interface\n22:20:32<dominictarr>it would be easy to polyfill other kv stores to the leveldb api\n22:20:45<dominictarr>or sql stores as well\n22:21:10<dominictarr>(ofcourse, you are ignoring most of the high level features there)\n22:21:18<juliangruber>so the question is, how does the most node style api for leveldb look like\n22:21:25<juliangruber>and i guess that is levelup\n22:21:30<Raynos>juliangruber: levelup has a pretty good api\n22:21:38<juliangruber>except for batches, chaining is better\n22:21:41<dominictarr>but that is pretty much a given for a unified interface\n22:21:54<Raynos>\"chaining is better\"\n22:22:05<Raynos>juliangruber: chaining is optional sugar a developer should opt into\n22:22:07<dominictarr>it depends on what you are doing\n22:22:08<Raynos>not the core api\n22:22:16<juliangruber>having the method in a field of the array sucks\n22:22:23<dominictarr>we don't need to paint a bike shed!\n22:22:24<juliangruber>or object\n22:22:24<Raynos>i prefer composition over chaining\n22:22:29<juliangruber>{ method : 'put' }\n22:23:00<dominictarr>the array is easier if you are generating the batch programmatically\n22:23:20<dominictarr>chaining looks better in a readme example\n22:23:25<juliangruber>maybe\n22:23:58<juliangruber>require('key-value')({ backend : 'levelup' })\n22:24:01<dominictarr>what does leveled do under the chaining?\n22:24:26<juliangruber>just pass anything it gets to c, not growing anything in js and then pass that to c\n22:24:28<dominictarr>gozala has an interesting approach to generating unified interfaces\n22:24:44<Raynos>yeah i do like method\n22:24:54<Raynos>juliangruber: why do you want a unified key value API\n22:25:05<dominictarr>so each call gets passed to C?\n22:25:44<dominictarr>I want a unified interface so I can build high level features and then have the low level stuff compete on performance\n22:25:49<juliangruber>Raynos: because I want to use one api that can have multiple backends like in-mem or fs\n22:26:04<Raynos>i dont think like that\n22:26:10<Raynos>I just thing \"use levelup\"\n22:26:14<Raynos>if I want in memory, which I do\n22:26:16<juliangruber>dominictarr: yes, batch.put() goes directly to c\n22:26:19<Raynos>ill build an in memory cache\n22:26:37<dominictarr>we need to get janl in on this conversation, he wants to reimplement leveldb in js\n22:27:01<Raynos>i see\n22:27:04<Raynos>that should be fun\n22:27:07<juliangruber>dominictarr: i thought about that too, that would be very interesting\n22:27:44<dominictarr>juliangruber, for my purposes I want to intercept puts and turn it into batches, to atomically add things like changes logs, or to queue map-reduce work etc\n22:27:51<juliangruber>dominictarr: although every batch.put() call goes to c it's faster then levelup bc levelup also iterates over that array\n22:28:21<dominictarr>your use case is special\n22:28:28<juliangruber>yup\n22:28:33<dominictarr>you really do need max performance\n22:28:38<dominictarr>fuck everything else\n22:28:55<dominictarr>I need features more than performance\n22:29:06<juliangruber>That's why there's almost no js in leveled, nice features should be added by wrappers. It's just the binding\n22:29:41<dominictarr>yeah, I could easily wrap your batch in a thing take an array like levelup has\n22:30:22<dominictarr>but just call the chaining stuff while iterating over the array.\n22:30:37<juliangruber>eventually I think levelup could swap its binding with leveldb and only do the nice js things\n22:30:44<juliangruber>*with leveled\n22:31:20<juliangruber>or I provide a levelup compatible wrapper\n22:31:25<dominictarr>right. there are some places where there are different compromises made\n22:31:32<dominictarr>like the range function\n22:31:40<juliangruber>mhm\n22:32:00<dominictarr>you are right to buffer everything and return it in one go for raw speed\n22:32:13<dominictarr>but there are other cases where it's faster to go slowly\n22:32:49<dominictarr>like if you have to send it over the network, or don't know how much of the range you actually want\n22:32:56<juliangruber>that still can be implemented on top of leveled, like split the range in even chunks and create a stream from that\n22:32:57<dominictarr>you can do that better with streams\n22:33:05<dominictarr>yup\n22:33:47<juliangruber>still the unified interface would be nice...because leveldb needs c and with that come compilation issues etc\n22:34:00<juliangruber>would be nice to provide a js-only backend\n22:34:14<dominictarr>yeah, it would make it easy to get started\n22:35:07<dominictarr>I can imagine some weird cases where it would be desirable to use an SQL backend too (!)\n22:35:16<juliangruber>haha yes! :D\n22:35:31<dominictarr>like cases where external factors are preventing you from accessing local disk\n22:35:44<juliangruber>or redis\n22:35:47<dominictarr>like on PaaS\n22:36:16<dominictarr>the api is pretty simple, we can make reusable tests that spec the api\n22:36:39<dominictarr>and make it a separate module that all the implementations can just run\n22:37:11<juliangruber>like your stream-spec\n22:37:36<dominictarr>yeah, but it will be a much tighter spec\n22:37:47<dominictarr>can include benchmarks too!\n22:38:13<juliangruber>sweet :)\n22:38:32<dominictarr>this is totally the database of the future\n22:38:38<juliangruber>it is\n22:38:51<juliangruber>leveldb directly in node, it's a dream\n22:38:57<juliangruber>have your heared about kdb?\n22:38:59<dominictarr>hey juliangruber are you gonna go/put in a proposal for mountainjs?\n22:39:07<dominictarr>no, what is kdb?\n22:39:43<juliangruber>it's like node, you build network apps and especially databases in it\n22:39:55<juliangruber>it has it's own languages, q and k (which are short!)\n22:39:59<juliangruber>and is super fast\n22:40:11<dominictarr>link?\n22:40:17<juliangruber>http://thesweeheng.wordpress.com/2008/11/30/more-sudoku-solvers-in-k-and-q/\n22:40:37<juliangruber>I've been introduced to the languages with those snippets\n22:40:49<juliangruber>hard to not get your brain on fire\n22:41:06<dominictarr>oh no, it's super terse!\n22:41:18<juliangruber>but also mighty\n22:41:22<juliangruber>i'd never use it\n22:41:34<dominictarr>does it have a module system that could fit into npm?\n22:41:42<juliangruber>there are given functions whose implementation is shorter than the name\n22:41:54<juliangruber>dunno, it's commercial anyway\n22:42:32<juliangruber>for mointainjs: you mean a talk about dbs in javascript?\n22:42:55<juliangruber>but kdb is basically the same direction as node and leveldb and it is used by hugh companies in production\n22:43:14<dominictarr>well anything, I'm gonna submit a proposal, and it's in your neck of the woods!\n22:43:43<juliangruber>yeah cool, me too :)\n22:43:59<juliangruber>would be my first conference talk\n22:44:11<dominictarr>sweet, my talk will be on building high level features on top of leveldb\n22:44:23<dominictarr>as that is what I'm super excited about right now\n22:44:34<dominictarr>you've done meetup talks?\n22:44:52<juliangruber>only university and in-company talks\n22:44:58<juliangruber>but i like giving talks\n22:46:03<dominictarr>cool\n22:46:12<dominictarr>so, who uses kdb?\n22:46:24<dominictarr>it looks interesting\n22:47:41<dominictarr>I'm getting a finance industry vibe from it\n22:47:56<juliangruber>yup\n22:48:18<juliangruber>can't tell you any names but the guy that evaluated it in my company said so\n22:50:35<dominictarr>I have a friend who has been working on an extremely terse language, I'll try to get him to come hangout\n22:51:31* yorickquit (Remote host closed the connection)\n22:51:36<juliangruber>will be cool to meet you :)\n22:51:46* yorickjoined\n22:51:46* yorickquit (Changing host)\n22:51:47* yorickjoined\n22:53:46* nrknjoined\n22:55:48<dominictarr>nrkn, welcomes to #stackvm!\n22:56:34<nrkn>Hola\n22:56:59<ralphtheninja>heya nrkn\n22:57:03<dominictarr>juliangruber, yeah! hopefully my talk is accepted\n22:57:35<dominictarr>so nrkn juliangruber was just telling me about k/q and it reminded me of tersch\n22:58:47<nrkn>Yeah I think I've vaguely come across them before while I was researching it.

or am i crazy\n23:10:51<fotoverite>Not following\n23:11:02<fotoverite>Write an api in node basically?\n23:11:31* tphummelquit (Quit: tphummel)\n23:11:38<mbalho>well here is an example\n23:11:42<mbalho>isaac wrote a module called redsesh\n23:11:50<mbalho>which is for doing sessions in node and persisting them in redis\n23:12:11<mbalho>but i might not want to run redis, i might want to store sessions in memory or use scuttlebutt to replicate sessions to all my servers\n23:12:39<mbalho>but all isaac was really doing was KV store stuff into redis, so i started working on (didnt finish) a redis API clone module that stored things into memory instead\n23:12:45<mbalho>so you could hook it up to scuttlebutt\n23:12:51<mbalho>but now there are all these competing leveldb apis coming out\n23:12:56<rvagg>if you just want get/put/del then the 3 leveldb bindings are all pretty much the same\n23:13:13<mbalho>and i feel like we should consider the possibility of a 'standardized' api for common things\n23:13:23<mbalho>rvagg: yea but it would be etra nice if there was a test suite that proved compatibility or omsething\n23:13:39<rvagg>or y'all could just contribute to levelup to make it the standard binding !\n23:14:03<mbalho>good point, im in the brainstorm phase still\n23:16:28<rvagg>I think my8bird/leveldb isn't worth caring about at this stage unless someone comes along to revive it, it's CoffeeScript too so meh.. I'm hoping that we can integrate some of the performance lessons that leveled can teach into levelup too and I'm thinking that the batch-get might be worth integrating too for smaller batches\n23:17:19<mbalho>agreed\n23:18:24<rvagg>need to flesh out the benchmarks more and I'd also like to benchmark against a sqlite binding too to make sure we can be properly fast\n23:18:55<mbalho>you've seen this right http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdwwvps4J9A&feature=plcp\n23:18:57<rvagg>but... time... the only time I have for it right now is the time created when I'm trying to avoid doing real work\n23:19:05<rvagg>ya\n23:19:08<mbalho>hahaha me too\n23:19:17<Raynos>o/\n23:19:31<mbalho>fucking jifasnif\n23:19:37<rvagg>heh\n23:19:39<Raynos>mbalho: I think jliangruber is writing that\n23:20:12<mbalho>Raynos: https://github.com/juliangruber/streamline-leveldb ?\n23:20:19<Raynos>yeah\n23:20:26<Raynos>not sure where he's going with it.\n23:20:31<Raynos>but he's writing it\n23:20:38<mbalho>juliangruber: you should make this non leveldb specific https://github.com/juliangruber/streamline-leveldb\n23:20:38<Raynos>I do feel that a KV binding is useful\n23:20:41<Raynos>but only for KV based backends\n23:20:47<mbalho>juliangruber: and more broadly useful for all databases\n23:21:07<Raynos>mbalho: have you seen model?\n23:21:18<mbalho>npm link?\n23:21:26<rvagg>mde/model?\n23:21:32<Raynos>https://npmjs.org/package/model\n23:21:35<Raynos>yeah.\n23:21:46<Raynos>when I say x I mean `npm docs x` :D\n23:22:03<mbalho>me too usually but that was a particularly general sounding term\n23:22:12<Raynos>true.\n23:22:16<Raynos>thats mde's fault\n23:22:19<Raynos>for writing a generic model\n23:23:31<mbalho>doesnt have streams :(\n23:23:31<rvagg>also 'downstairs' is another, he's hoping to make it k/v compatible too but it's mainly for sql models\n23:26:02<mbalho>model and downstairs both seem really big in scope compared to what i was thinking\n23:26:35<mbalho>like... npm install streaming-database\n23:28:35<mbalho>but i guess from a design perspective the streaming-database package would just be a test suite or something\n23:28:58<mbalho>and it wouldnt put multiple adapters in one repo like this https://github.com/mde/model/tree/master/lib/adapters\n23:29:57<Raynos>mbalho: well can we just write a test suite for the levelup interface?\n23:30:07<Raynos>oh wait someone already wrote that :D\n23:30:41<mbalho>well what im getting at is non leveldb use cases\n23:31:07<mbalho>but what i havent thought about as much is which databases would it make sense at all to use a leveldb style api on top of\n23:31:27<mbalho>given that leveldb exposes lexicographically sorted one dimensional indexes via single or batch atomic read/writes\n23:31:39<mbalho>you can do that in memory, you can do that in redis, you can do that in sql probably\n23:31:54<mbalho>couch is pretty much the same as leveldb at the api level\n23:32:41<Raynos>mbalho: but why use the leveldb api\n23:32:45<Raynos>on top of sql couch or redis\n23:32:51<Raynos>why not use it on top of level\n23:32:58<Raynos>an in memory clone of leveldb makes sense\n23:33:03<Raynos>and im going to write that\n23:33:04<mbalho>how would you run leveldb on nodejitsu\n23:33:07<rvagg>cause when you love hammers, everything looks like a nail?\n23:33:10<Raynos>well im going to write an in memory cache in front of leveldb\n23:33:31<Raynos>mbalho: you punch nodejitsu in the face until it lets you install arbitary shit on the smartos vm\n23:33:43<rvagg>levelup works on nodejitsu... minus persistence across drones of course... but that's why we need levelup-AAS !\n23:33:56<Raynos>levelup-AAS ?\n23:34:01<Raynos>as a service >_<\n23:34:06<mbalho>nodejitsu ensures disk persistence?? i did not realize\n23:34:22<mbalho>heroku doesnt\n23:34:30<rvagg>only on the current drone\n23:35:06<rvagg>mind you... I've never actually used levelup on nodejitsu for anything real, I just know it compiles and is usable there\n23:35:52<mbalho>anyway its not a hammer/nail thing, its just annoys me that modules like redsess are written in a database specific manner even though they could have just as easily been made generic but there is no pattern that people can use easily when authoring those types of modules\n23:35:55<Raynos>but I do agree\n23:36:01<Raynos>it feels that there is a more generic thing\n23:36:13<Raynos>that we should have\n23:36:28<Raynos>what does redis give you that leveldb doesnt have?\n23:36:29<mbalho>we have module.exports = function(){}, cb(err, data) and .pipe()\n23:36:33<Raynos>does redis have range queries?\n23:36:46<mbalho>Raynos: it has sets and set intersection stuff\n23:36:50<rvagg>Raynos: give us memory caching and bingo!\n23:37:11<Raynos>memory caching is interesting\n23:37:14<rvagg>with lru\n23:37:18<Raynos>because you can _optionally_ persist to the real thing\n23:37:35<Raynos>so ill write that\n23:37:59<rvagg>ya, we could make a redis clone backed by leveldb for persistence, that'd be neat\n23:38:07<rvagg>but again... avoiding real work\n23:38:22<mbalho>well now there are 5 people working on this stuff, roughly\n23:38:31<mbalho>but if we increased that number to 10 then more things would happen :D\n23:38:43<rvagg>perhaps nearForm wants to 'sponsor' more of us\n23:38:44<mbalho>and it turns out there are lotsa node programmers that use databases\n23:40:33<mbalho>anyway, on the other hand for things like redsess i could just fork it and write a new module based on it that is levelup specific and it would be less work than convincing a module author to switch their development approach\n23:41:15<Raynos>mbalho: what we really want\n23:41:23<Raynos>is `var session = RedSess(db, ...)`\n23:41:31<Raynos>and have db confirm to the \"kv interface\"\n23:41:46<mbalho>npm install lexicographically-sorted-one-dimensional-index\n23:42:08<Raynos>:D\n23:43:09<mbalho>Raynos: but redsess has red from redis in the name, might as well fork it to be generic. it isnt a large module\n23:43:28<mbalho>but i really want a session store that uses scuttlebutt to replicate between nodes, that would be super cool\n23:44:26<rvagg>mmmm\n23:45:12<mbalho>i wonder how many keys you can store in npm lru-cache before it hits the v8 memory limit\n23:45:23* paul_irish_changed nick to paul_irish\n23:50:01<dominictarr>mbalho, rvagg Raynos so juliangruber and I where talking about building a compatible API across levelup/leveled and using a separate test suite\n23:51:04<dominictarr>the problem with using a compatibility layer over a network accessable db is that those databases\n23:51:35<dominictarr>can be accessed by multiple processes, which it's assumed cannot be done via leveldb\n23:51:57<mbalho>its not just assumed it is confirmed :D\n23:52:17<dominictarr>yeah, so you'd want to run one db per client\n23:52:25<dominictarr>and then replicate between the clients\n23:52:27<mbalho>you can have 1 node process open many leveldbs\n23:52:35<dominictarr>yes\n23:52:54<dominictarr>although, you can't do atomic inserts across multiple db\n23:53:32<dominictarr>replication between your multiple processes is a better idea, nodejitsu compatible too\n23:53:34<mbalho>so redis, for instance, hosts an application server\n23:53:38<mbalho>that many node processes can talk to\n23:53:53<mbalho>if you were to use a compatibility layer to do redis on leveldb or something\n23:54:01<mbalho>node would be both the application server and the many clients\n23:54:10<dominictarr>yes\n23:54:47<dominictarr>most of the highlevel features that I am building depend on being in control of all the inputs\n23:55:05<mbalho>so what scenario were you referring to above when you mentioned lotsa dbs assume multiple process access\n23:55:10<dominictarr>so, you can intercept (or detect) when a user inserts something\n23:55:20<dominictarr>mysql, couch, etc\n23:55:43<dominictarr>databases which are not designed to be embedded in the user process.\n23:55:59<mbalho>so you make a local proxy compatibility server?\n23:56:04<dominictarr>pretty much all db except sqlite, leveldb, and tokyo cabnet\n23:56:05<mbalho>is that too much indirection\n23:56:33<dominictarr>well, you could have one process, and one db running on the same machine\n23:56:41<dominictarr>and stick to that\n23:57:03<dominictarr>you'd need a wacky reason not to just use leveldb\n23:57:33<mbalho>ok another crazy idea\n23:57:47<mbalho>npm install streaming-database; db = streamingDatabase(uri)\n23:57:56<mbalho>where uri is either 'idb://foobar' in browsers\n23:58:03<mbalho>'http://foobar' for http+json\n23:58:08<mbalho>'file://foobar' for leveldb\n23:59:12<dominictarr>well, we argeady have 2 idb->leveldb polyfills\n00:00:52<mbalho>it just concerns me that the barrier to entry for all this stuff we are working on is knowledge of lots of nerdy shit :)\n00:01:06<dominictarr>no way!\n00:01:11<dominictarr>it's pretty simple\n00:01:28<dominictarr>oh, it can be hard to get it to compile\n00:03:56<rvagg>from the usage stats for levelup vs the number of compile problems reported I think most people are compiling fine\n00:04:03<rvagg>but it's something I need to work on more\n00:05:04<dominictarr>leveled compiled fine for me\n00:05:46<dominictarr>ALSO janl told me at jsconf.eu that we wanted to reimplement leveled in pure js.\n00:06:18<mbalho>leveldb not leveled\n00:06:37<mbalho>(thats what he told me at least)\n00:06:43<rvagg>dominictarr: I saw that mentioned on pouchdb github but haven't got a response about progress\n00:06:43<dominictarr>sorry, correct\n00:06:57<mbalho>he is also busy\n00:07:47<dominictarr>if we have other cool stuff, like map reduce, and a reusable test suite, then maybe we can get him more excited about this\n00:08:06<mbalho>yea thats way true\n00:08:32<dominictarr>the time is ripe for leveldb\n00:09:10<mbalho>ill try to revive my geohash point indexer on top of my8bird leveldb\n00:14:00<mbalho>woot https://gist.github.com/4137796\n00:14:17<fotoverite>woot\n00:15:18<mbalho>oh wait subtack published that already https://github.com/substack/polyhash\n00:15:28<mbalho>its just hella slow\n00:16:29<mbalho>heres a shapefile indexer that i got working sorta https://gist.github.com/4137801\n00:26:36* yorickquit (Remote host closed the connection)\n00:29:45<dominictarr>mbalho, we probably just want to start with a way to index points, and things happening withing a radius or bounding box.\n00:30:44* thatguydanquit (Quit: thatguydan)\n00:38:13* thatguydanjoined\n00:38:47<mbalho>the last gist i posted indexes only points and gives you a radius query\n00:39:27<mbalho>it also lets you upload point shapefiles to index them\n00:39:42<mbalho>i started doing querying by polygon but didnt finish it\n00:46:58* thatguydanquit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)\n00:48:29<Raynos>dominictarr, rvagg: I think dominic is right and leveldb needs some kind of plugin system\n00:48:52<rvagg>code it up then brother\n00:49:30<dominictarr>I'm doing that right now\n00:50:22<Raynos>I dont like plugin systems :p.

foo=require('./foo')\n01:15:22<chrisdickinson>so the problem is that you need to define some linkage\n01:15:31<chrisdickinson>also you can't have quotes in glsl ):\n01:15:54<substack>the preprocessor would strip everything out\n01:16:19<chrisdickinson>no, gl will barf if there's a string anywhere, even in a stripped out part.\n01:16:29<chrisdickinson>(just tested it on

starting with the leafs\n21:55:45<defunctzombie>so you still have to read a few files before you can emit a dependency\n21:56:04<defunctzombie>but once you start emitting leafs, downstream should be able to do things with them\n21:56:11<substack>that could work\n21:56:22<substack>that would be really neat actually\n21:56:30<substack>depth-first\n21:56:33<defunctzombie>yes\n21:56:43<defunctzombie>you basically have to if you want anything useful out of it\n21:56:57<defunctzombie>cause otherwise you don't yet know the paths for some deps\n21:57:05<defunctzombie>which makes it tricker to process downstream\n21:57:22<defunctzombie>since you will essentially \"block\" till you have that info (at least from the way I see it)\n21:57:29<substack>well if your plugin needs to process dependencies at all\n21:57:31<substack>most won't\n21:57:37<substack>thinking of a good example that would\n21:58:48* davidoccamjoined\n21:59:09<defunctzombie>the other thing to consider is, do you treat this as a serial processing pipeline or general stream\n21:59:47<defunctzombie>if your downstream plugin takes a while, then deps will be spewed out faster than you might be processing them\n22:01:00<substack>the plugins can just implement a pause stream themselves or get the OS to buffer for them

t._progeny(). then, in onend, calling pending.unshift.apply(pending, the kids)\n22:02:14<isaacs>substack: so they get pushed in order, then unshifted all at once\n22:02:16<substack>basically I want to use my tap tests for all my node modules in browsers\n22:03:04<substack>isaacs: what about storing t.parent and then computing an index to splice-insert into instead of a naive unshift()?\n22:03:36*

with a pending array.\n22:05:17<isaacs>node-tap does it with this complicated \"tests are also harnesses\" thing, and then it's like a tree that gets walked\n22:05:32<isaacs>which sounds nice, but in practice, is kind of a huge pita\n22:05:51<substack>also I previously had nested tests get indented but the tap parser didn't like those so I took them out\n22:06:06<isaacs>yeah, that's a bug in the

with\n22:13:34<isaacs>that's why we should write smaller modules. they don't age as quickly\n22:14:04<tanepiper>it's more about letting grunt know which environment to run it in using multitasks (no point testing code with fs or process in the browser)\n22:14:15<tanepiper>or window in node\n22:14:23<isaacs>hooray, 0.0.2!\n22:14:27<substack>0.0.2 published yep\n22:31:46* ralphtheninjajoined\n22:33:59<dominictarr>substack, prehaps we can use this for wizzards http://vimeo.com/54233383\n22:34:37<substack>nice!\n22:36:33<dominictarr>defunctzombie, substack streaming deps leaf first will mean you have to output them in topological sort order, which is the most sensible ordering\n22:36:38<dominictarr>so, that is a good thing.\n22:37:29<defunctzombie>dominictarr: substack: one hiccup I have with streaming deps is how they fit in with shims\n22:37:41<dominictarr>shims?\n22:37:48<defunctzombie>with a leaf dep, it might not be immediately obvious it should be ignored\n22:37:57<defunctzombie>so when I package modules\n22:38:06<defunctzombie>that have deps that don't work on the browser\n22:38:11<defunctzombie>I shim them out\n22:38:43<dominictarr>oh, so you load a \"client\" version instead?\n22:38:45<defunctzombie>yes\n22:39:07<defunctzombie>the best up to date example I have is: https://github.com/shtylman/engine.io-client/blob/master/package.json#L28\n22:39:17<defunctzombie>the bundler tool I use detects this\n22:39:23<defunctzombie>when you require engine.io\n22:39:30<defunctzombie>and uses those files instead\n22:40:03<defunctzombie>this makes the src in the project the same for client/server and lets the bundle step handle compat\n22:40:17<defunctzombie>(I think browserify has a similar concept but don't recall the field)\n22:40:57<defunctzombie>so the issue that streaming deps with shims creates is that I don't want the leafs for the 'ws' node.js module\n22:41:04<defunctzombie>and would need a way to detect that\n22:41:16<defunctzombie>so far.. the only way I can do that is by having the full dep tree\n22:41:22<defunctzombie>and pruning a branch\n22:42:13* st_lukequit (Remote host closed the connection)\n22:42:27<substack>defunctzombie: you could submit a patch to ws\n22:42:36<substack>or engine.io\n22:42:50<defunctzombie>well, the point is that the shim field would be the patch\n22:42:54<defunctzombie>that is the part I added\n22:43:11<defunctzombie>they want the codebase to work in node.js\n22:43:14<defunctzombie>and the browser\n22:43:33<defunctzombie>but things like 'ws' are node.js only\n22:44:12<defunctzombie>the shim thing works, but with streaming deps I do foresee a problem with that approach\n22:44:38<defunctzombie>actually, maybe not, if you just stream the originating file\n22:44:40<defunctzombie>that might work\n22:44:56<defunctzombie>when you stream a dep, you have the whole chain of files that led to it\n22:45:03<defunctzombie>starting with the initial \"require\" call\n22:45:10* frabcusjoined\n22:45:21<defunctzombie>you could easily check that and ignore if needed\n22:45:25<defunctzombie>fascinating\n22:45:39<defunctzombie>yea, I think that would work\n22:45:58<defunctzombie>so when you stream out a dep, you have to stream out its lineage\n22:46:07<defunctzombie>otherwise you have information loss\n22:48:55<defunctzombie>substack: https://gist.github.com/4145739\n22:49:06<defunctzombie>I think if you \"emitted\" this for each dependency\n22:49:10<defunctzombie>it would be doable\n22:49:20<defunctzombie>note that parent does not have the source\n22:49:26<defunctzombie>since that will come when the parent is emitted\n22:50:01<defunctzombie>this lets anyone interested in the lineage of the dep get that\n22:50:10<substack>seems like it would be fine without emitting the entire parents tree if you emitted depth-first\n22:50:29<defunctzombie>substack: then you miss the ability to ignore\n22:50:34<defunctzombie>that is the point of the parent tree\n22:50:43<substack>you just build the linked list yourself\n22:50:53<defunctzombie>to know that require('foo') when inside of require('bar') should be ignored\n22:50:57<substack>you only need the filename of the parent, not the grandparents\n22:51:14<defunctzombie>nope.. gotta go all the way back\n22:51:22<defunctzombie>foo inside bar inside baz\n22:51:28<defunctzombie>and say you want to ignore anything in baz\n22:51:34<defunctzombie>and you got foo first\n22:51:36<substack>key an ignore hash by filename\n22:52:16<defunctzombie>don't see how that helps\n22:52:19<substack>var ignore = {}; if (ignore[dep.parent.filename]) ignore[dep.filename] = true\n22:52:46<substack>or rather, that would work for breadth-first\n22:52:51<defunctzombie>right\n22:52:55<defunctzombie>that is my point\n22:53:04<defunctzombie>if my dep tree is baz -> bar -> foo\n22:53:04<substack>breadth-first is easier anyhow\n22:53:10<defunctzombie>I will get foo first\n22:53:14<defunctzombie>but need to know it came from baz\n22:53:17<defunctzombie>to properly ignore it\n22:53:31<substack>anyhow if you want that don't make it nested\n22:53:33<substack>make it flat\n22:53:44<substack>parents : [ file1, file2, ... ]\n22:54:35<defunctzombie>to what benefit?\n22:54:51<substack>you don't need to write a recursive traversal just to pick off the parents\n22:55:03<substack>recursively nested data structures are not very nice to deal with\n22:55:32<defunctzombie>it is like 5 lines of code\n22:55:40<defunctzombie>since there is no async element to it\n22:56:07<defunctzombie>could make it an ordered list versus tree\n22:56:22<substack>but those 5 lines would just turn the tree into an array\n22:56:28<defunctzombie>with first item being the parent, then gparent, and so on\n22:56:29<substack>just have an array to start with\n22:56:32<substack>everything is easier\n22:56:41<substack>yes, ordered\n22:56:47<substack>that's what arrays are good at being\n22:57:30<defunctzombie>ok.. now can it be done with breath first vs depth\n22:57:36<defunctzombie>and more importantly.. should it\n22:57:41<substack>yes\n22:58:36<defunctzombie>so now you are

What about dest.on(\"close\" ?\n04:48:38<Raynos>usecase is someone does src.pipe(dest) but dest closes itself once its read N items\n04:48:59<isaacs>Raynos: then it should emit end, not close\n04:49:07<Raynos>dest is a writable not a readable\n04:49:20<isaacs>Raynos: oic, well, that's odd\n04:49:30<isaacs>Raynos: it should unpipe itself then, not close\n04:49:32<Raynos>there are a bunch of cases where someone would destroy a writable stream but not emit error\n04:49:42<Raynos>specifically with mux-demux\n04:49:47<isaacs>Raynos: dest.on('pipe', function(src) { when i've got 5 items, src.unpipe(this) })\n04:50:13<Raynos>well what about source.pipe(socket) but the user on the other end of the socket disconnects\n04:50:18<Raynos>then the socket would emit close not error\n04:50:36<Raynos>thats the main usecase im trying to protect against\n04:53:10<Raynos>isaacs: there are a bunch of situations in which a writable may become unwritable early without the pipe being finished. What about listening on \"finish\" of a writable in pipe and doing unpipe?\n04:53:27<isaacs>Raynos: \"finish\" would be the event to care about, then\n04:53:29<ik>fishpipes\n04:53:38<isaacs>Raynos: but if it's forcibly closed, then who's to say it'll emit \"finish\"\n04:53:41<isaacs>Raynos: hm...\n04:53:51<isaacs>Raynos: \"finish\" indicates that end() was called, and everything flushed\n04:54:04<isaacs>Raynos: but in the case of a client disconnect, the bytes *don't* get flushed\n04:54:21<isaacs>Raynos: and end() is never called, so it doesn't know it needs to emit \"fihinish\"\n04:54:39<Raynos>we can bastardize finish to mean \"this stream has finished flushing any data IT WILL EVER FLUSH\"\n04:54:51<isaacs>Raynos: fuck. You're right.

      "text": "Startup es una de esas palabras que hoy en d\u00eda est\u00e1 de moda, pero que no siempre se sabe qu\u00e9 es. Ni si quiera encontramos siempre la misma definici\u00f3n.\n\u00bfEs Google una startup? La respuesta es no. \u00bfY Facebook? Tampoco. \u00bfEs mi empresa tecnol\u00f3gica una startup? La respuesta es: puede que s\u00ed, puede que no. Empezar\u00e9 por el principio para que podamos comprender todo esto al final del post.\nSeg\u00fan Steve Blank, \u201cuna startup es una organizaci\u00f3n temporal en b\u00fasqueda de un modelo de negocio escalable y replicable\u201d. La definici\u00f3n es concisa pero cargada de contenido, cada palabra tiene un profundo significado que nos har\u00e1 comprender muy bien lo que realmente es una startup:\n\u201corganizaci\u00f3n temporal\u201d: Una startup solamente lo es durante un tiempo determinado. Pasado este tiempo se convierte en una compa\u00f1\u00eda sostenible o finalmente muere.\n\u201cen b\u00fasqueda de un modelo de negocio\u201d: Una startup inicialmente no sabe cu\u00e1l es su modelo de negocio. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? Porque normalmente se crean basadas en productos o mercados no existentes hasta la fecha, en un entorno de alta innovaci\u00f3n e incertidumbre, donde todav\u00eda es necesario descubrir c\u00f3mo hacer negocio de un modo sostenible.\n\u201cmodelo de negocio escalable y replicable\u201d: Cualquier tipo de negocio no puede ser una startup. Es necesario que tenga un alto potencial de crecimiento y para ello debe ser f\u00e1cilmente escalable, en cuanto a su tama\u00f1o, y replicable, para llevar este modelo de negocio a otros mercados (geogr\u00e1ficos, sectoriales, etc.).\nNormalmente las startups son tecnol\u00f3gicas, ya que las tecnolog\u00edas modernas (sobre todo Internet) es lo que ha permitido el desarrollo de este tipo de empresas innovadoras y globales. Sin embargo, el hecho de que una empresa sea tecnol\u00f3gica no quiere decir que sea una startup, ya que su modelo de negocio podr\u00eda no ser escalable y replicable.\nExisten otras definiciones de startup alternativas, Eric Ries (cuyo mentor fue Steve Blank) nos da esta definici\u00f3n en su bestseller Lean Startup: \u201cuna startup es una instituci\u00f3n humana dise\u00f1ada para crear un nuevo producto o servicio bajo condiciones de extrema incertidumbre\u201d.\nEn este caso, la definici\u00f3n es algo m\u00e1s amplia, ya que no hace referencia al tipo de modelo de negocio sino que se centra m\u00e1s en el hecho de estar en un entorno de alta incertidumbre como consecuencia de basar los productos o servicios en una fuerte innovaci\u00f3n. Esta definici\u00f3n no solamente engloba a startups como tal, sino que incluso puede englobar a nuevos productos o servicios que se lancen desde una compa\u00f1\u00eda ya consolidada.\nDe hecho, las metodolog\u00edas Lean Startup (de las que hablaremos mucho en este blog) no solo est\u00e1n orientadas a startups sino que tambi\u00e9n pueden ser aplicadas en grandes organizaciones e instituciones.\nSi tuviese que quedarme con una definici\u00f3n mezclar\u00eda ambas y dir\u00eda que \u201cuna startup es una organizaci\u00f3n temporal en b\u00fasqueda de un modelo de negocio escalable y replicable bajo condiciones de extrema incertidumbre\u201d.\nUna vez dada la descripci\u00f3n de lo que es una startup, responder\u00e9 con algo m\u00e1s de detalle a las preguntas iniciales que hac\u00eda en el post (aunque a estas alturas todos los que hay\u00e1is le\u00eddo el art\u00edculo podr\u00edais responderlas igual que yo):\n\u00bfEs Google una startup? No, Google es una empresa con un modelo de negocio sostenible (y muy rentable). Google fue una startup hace varios a\u00f1os, cuando lanzaron su buscador y pasaron una temporada buscando c\u00f3mo hacer negocio con un buscador en Internet de un modo escalable y replicable (\u00a1y vaya si lo consiguieron!). No obstante, algunos de sus nuevos productos y proyectos si los podr\u00edamos considerar \u201cstartups internas\u201d. Pero este es otro tema.\n\u00bfEs Facebook una startup? No, Facebook tambi\u00e9n es una empresa con un modelo de negocio sostenible, aunque no tan rentable como el ejemplo anterior. Tampoco tienen una estrategia tan centrada en desarrollar un portfolio de productos, como hace Google, para complementar el ecosistema de servicios ofrecidos a su usuario y escalar, de este modo, su negocio. Pero esto vuelve a ser otro tema distinto\u2026\n\u00bfEs mi empresa una startup? Puede que s\u00ed, puede que no. El hecho de que tu empresa tenga una base tecnol\u00f3gica no quiere decir que sea una startup. Un claro ejemplo son las empresas de tecnolog\u00eda de desarrollo de servicios a medida, estas no son startups porque para replicar el negocio tienen que replicar su estructura de personal, lo cual dificulta la escalabilidad. Sin embargo, si tu empresa tiene un producto o servicio f\u00e1cilmente escalable (por ejemplo SaaS), seguramente lo sea. Eso si, el d\u00eda que alcances tu punto de equilibrio financiero de un modo sostenible, habr\u00e1s dejado de ser una startup\u2026 lo cu\u00e1l, por cierto, es muy buena noticia\nComo conclusi\u00f3n, os dir\u00eda que os qued\u00e1seis con la idea de que una startup no es la versi\u00f3n peque\u00f1a de una gran empresa. Esto nos obligar\u00e1 a gestionar una startup de un modo distinto al que gestionar\u00edamos otro tipo de empresa, centr\u00e1ndonos m\u00e1s en la b\u00fasqueda de nuestro modelo de negocio y menos en la ejecuci\u00f3n de un plan de negocio previamente marcado. Y precisamente sobre todos estos temas hablar\u00e9 en los pr\u00f3ximos post de este blog.",

So instead of our regular Logo Design News which we post nearly every Friday, here\u2019s a round up of links from around the web that we recommend for small business owners:\nEntrepreneur Breakdowns and Breakthroughs\n Key Idea (actually there are lots of great ideas in this video): \u201cI\u2019ve had my share of failures. That\u2019s kinda what makes a person ready for success.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the whole video:\nFrom Inc Magazine: An Interview with Sir Richard Branson on entrepreneurial audacity.\n Key Idea: \u201c\u2026true audaciousness comes about with just those people who have the pluck and the courage to say: Screw it; let\u2019s do it.\u201d (Bonus: here are 9 inspiring things Richard Branson has said about small business.)\nMore from Inc Magazine: 6 TED Talks Every Entrepreneur Should Watch. Lots of good stuff here from insights on creativity to disagreement.\nFrom Ryan Carson, CEO of Treehouse: 3 Mistakes Every Entrepreneur Should Avoid.\n Key Idea: \u201cI met with our accountant quarterly to sign off the accounts and it always felt like a nuisance. I thought all that mattered was the cash-flow\u2026 I was just focusing on how much cash we had and whether we had enough to make it through the next three months.\u201d Lots of good stuff in the comments too.\nFrom Paul Graham: How to Get Start-up Ideas. It\u2019s long but worth it.\n Key Idea: \u201cWhy do so many founders build things no one wants? Because they begin by trying to think of startup ideas. That m.o. is doubly dangerous: it doesn\u2019t merely yield few good ideas; it yields bad ideas that sound plausible enough to fool you into working on them.\u201d Sounds like advice from the excellent book: Nail It Then Scale It.\nFrom David Hauser: 25 Entrepreneurs Tell What they Wish They\u2019d Known\u2026\n Key Idea: \u201cSince entrepreneurs are the most qualified to give other entrepreneurs advice about starting a business, I decided to ask 25 entrepreneurs about the number one thing they wish they\u2019d known before founding their first startup\u2026 It\u2019s invaluable whether you\u2019ve recently started a business or you\u2019re looking to start one.\u201d\nThe post More Small Business Start-up Links to Check Out appeared first on Logomaker Blog.]]>\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2012/11/23/more-small-business-start-up-links-to-check-out/feed/\n0\n5 Small Business Links Worth Reading (On Email, Search Rankings, and More)\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2012/10/25/5-small-business-links-worth-reading-on-email-search-rankings-and-more/\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2012/10/25/5-small-business-links-worth-reading-on-email-search-rankings-and-more/#comments\nThu, 25 Oct 2012 18:00:41 +0000\nRob Marsh\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/?p=2559\nEach week we stumble across lots of articles worth passing on to the many small business owners who visit Logomaker every day.

Out of all the great information, articles, and blog posts out there, here are a few we definitely think you should check out:\nFrom Website Magazine: Journey to the Top of the SERPs\n Key idea: \u201cBut the more telling information comes from looking at the clicks on organic results. Compete says that 53 percent of those clicks go to the top organic listing, and the number decreases significantly from there. The second link gets 15 percent of the clicks, while the third gets nine percent, the fourth sees six percent and the fifth is clicked on just four percent of the time.\u201d\nFrom ClickZ: 5 Tips to Empower Your Email Marketing\n Key Idea: \u201cEvery message you send and every open (and click) is a way for you to build up on your value proposition. Continue looking at branding, the consumer\u2019s attention span, and your ability to convert the consumer to a customer. Your biggest success would be driven by focusing on getting the consumer to trust you\u2026\u201d\nFrom MarketingProfs: What\u2019s the Best Time to Send Your Email?\n Key Idea: \u201cThe top engagement times for email are as follows: in the mornings, 8 AM to 9 AM both for opens and click-throughs; and in the afternoons, 3 PM to 8 PM for opens, and 3 PM and 4 PM for click-throughs.\u201d\nFrom QuickSprout: Why Content Marketing is the New SEO\n Key Idea: \u201cSEO isn\u2019t the same as what it used to be. You can\u2019t just popup an ugly website, throw up mediocre content, and build a few links and expect to rank well.\u201d\nFrom Jason Fried: Some Advice from Jeff Bezos\n Key Idea: \u201cpeople who were right a lot of the time were people who often changed their minds. He doesn\u2019t think consistency of thought is a particularly positive trait. It\u2019s perfectly healthy \u2014 encouraged, even \u2014 to have an idea tomorrow that contradicted your idea today.\u201d\nPhoto Credit: drp via photopin cc\nThe post 5 Small Business Links Worth Reading (On Email, Search Rankings, and More) appeared first on Logomaker Blog.]]>\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2012/10/25/5-small-business-links-worth-reading-on-email-search-rankings-and-more/feed/\n0\n5 Links Worth Reading\u2014On Small Business & Logo Design\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2012/10/18/5-links-worth-reading-on-small-business-logo-design/\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2012/10/18/5-links-worth-reading-on-small-business-logo-design/#comments\nThu, 18 Oct 2012 22:22:01 +0000\nRob Marsh\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/?p=2546\nWe strive to present interesting ideas and news in this blog for small business owners.

Along the way we come across a lot of great information on other websites. Today we\u2019ve collected a few that we\u2019ve liked recently on subjects like logo design and building your business. Check them out:\nFrom Marketing Profs: Your Brand Is More Than a Logo.\n Key idea: \u201cA logo is a vital element of how you communicate your brand. A logo is the visual representation of who and what you are. But your logo is just the beginning of your brand.\u201d\nFrom Seth Godin and EarWolf: StartUp School\n What it is: In this rare live recording, hear Seth as he guides thirty entrepreneurs through a workshop exploring how they can build and run their dream business. You can also find it on iTunes.\nFrom JJ Ramberg: 4 Essential Tips to Transform Your Small Business\n Key idea: \u201c\u2026for the past many years I\u2019ve been in this really lucky position of getting to interview people about how they\u2019re growing their business and then use those tips in my own company. Here are some of the things I\u2019ve learned along the way.\u201d\nFrom Forbes: Stop Futzing With Your Logo and Get Back to Work!\n Key idea: \u201cThis small business owner was guilty of focusing on a tangential issue (dated corporate identity graphics) rather than on the core issue: Is his business sustainably delivering on its brand promise? If so, the current logo represents something positive. If not, fixing the problems within the business is far more important than revising a logo.\u201d\nFrom SEOMoz: Getting On Page SEO Right\n Key idea: \u201cPeople abandon search results much more quickly than they used to. Rankings doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to the traffic. We see click-through rates sometimes on position two, three, or four being higher than on position one because something is more interesting about the listing.\u201d\nBonus Link (from the Logomaker Blog Archive): 20 Questions to Ask About Your Brand.\nPhoto Credit: Rigmarole via photopin cc\nThe post 5 Links Worth Reading\u2014On Small Business & Logo Design appeared first on Logomaker Blog.]]>\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2012/10/18/5-links-worth-reading-on-small-business-logo-design/feed/\n0\nNow for Something Not Related to Logo Design\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2012/02/08/now-for-something-not-related-to-logo-design/\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2012/02/08/now-for-something-not-related-to-logo-design/#comments\nWed, 08 Feb 2012 23:14:39 +0000\nRob Marsh\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/?p=1081\nIf you\u2019re a returning visitor to this blog, you know we write a lot about logo design.

What makes a good logo. News about logos. How you can create your own logo. You get the picture.\nBut we also write a little bit about what it takes to start a small business. And, for those who are doing just that, how we might be able to help.\nToday, we\u2019ll point you to two interesting articles we found this week. The first from Forbes magazine about the hottest industries for starting a new business. If you\u2019re thinking about starting your own business now, you may find greater success in one of these industries. Click here to read the article. And if you don\u2019t see your industry listed, don\u2019t be dismayed\u2014it may mean you\u2019ll have less competition for your new venture.\nWe also want to point you to a short article from the Harvard Business Review on why you probably won\u2019t quit your job and start that business after all. You think you\u2019re ready to move on, but you still won\u2019t quit. Here\u2019s why.\nInteresting reading to keep you busy until next Friday\u2019s edition of Logo Design This Week.\nThe post Now for Something Not Related to Logo Design appeared first on Logomaker Blog.]]>\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2012/02/08/now-for-something-not-related-to-logo-design/feed/\n0\nLogo Design This Week\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2011/09/23/logo-design-this-week/\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2011/09/23/logo-design-this-week/#comments\nFri, 23 Sep 2011 21:07:11 +0000\nRob Marsh\nhttp://logomaker.com/blog/?p=159\nInterested in following what\u2019s going on in the world of logo design?

Here are a few of the top news stories this week:\nThe new logo to be used on Miami Marlins uniforms next year was leaked. We\u2019re don\u2019t think it\u2019s an improvement over the old logo. Maybe it was leaked to generate bad press and sent the project back to the drawing board? If so, it appears to be working.\nNot to be outdone, a new Toronto Blue Jays logo was also leaked. This one we like.\nHyatt introduced a new logo for it\u2019s Hyatt House division of extended stay hotels. See the press release here, which describes but doesn\u2019t show the new logo, which you can find here.\nHeineken also introduced a new look for it\u2019s corporate brand this week. We like it\u2019s clean, strong look. From the sound of it, the packaging you\u2019ll see in the supermarket won\u2019t be changing (yet).\nThe Seattle Times has a nice article about Terry Heckler, the designer who created the Starbucks logo (among others). Worth reading if you have even a passing interest in logo design.\nKashiwa Sato created a new logo for the \u201cCool Japan\u201d campaign designed to create more interest in Japan after a bad year of publicity (Tsunami, nuclear meltdown, etc.). Check it out here.\nLogo Design Love points us to a short history (video) of the Ferrari logo. Interesting.\nFinally, the 2010 WOLDA Logo Design Contest winners were announced. Some nice work, worth checking out. And the owners of the site appear to be looking for someone to take on the contest next year, in case you\u2019re interested.\nDid we leave anything out? If so, add your link in the comments.\nNeed a logo? Try your hand at creating one with the free logo design tool at Logomaker.com. Seriously, check it out. It\u2019s free.\nThe post Logo Design This Week appeared first on Logomaker Blog.]]>\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2011/09/23/logo-design-this-week/feed/\n0",

Lots of good stuff here from insights on creativity to disagreement.\nFrom Ryan Carson, CEO of Treehouse: 3 Mistakes Every Entrepreneur Should Avoid.\n Key Idea: \u201cI met with our accountant quarterly to sign off the accounts and it always felt like a nuisance. I thought all that mattered was the cash-flow\u2026 I was just focusing on how much cash we had and whether we had enough to make it through the next three months.\u201d Lots of good stuff in the comments too.\nFrom Paul Graham: How to Get Start-up Ideas. It\u2019s long but worth it.\n Key Idea: \u201cWhy do so many founders build things no one wants? Because they begin by trying to think of startup ideas. That m.o. is doubly dangerous: it doesn\u2019t merely yield few good ideas; it yields bad ideas that sound plausible enough to fool you into working on them.\u201d Sounds like advice from the excellent book: Nail It Then Scale It.\nFrom David Hauser: 25 Entrepreneurs Tell What they Wish They\u2019d Known\u2026\n Key Idea: \u201cSince entrepreneurs are the most qualified to give other entrepreneurs advice about starting a business, I decided to ask 25 entrepreneurs about the number one thing they wish they\u2019d known before founding their first startup\u2026 It\u2019s invaluable whether you\u2019ve recently started a business or you\u2019re looking to start one.\u201d\nThe post More Small Business Start-up Links to Check Out appeared first on Logomaker Blog.]]>\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2012/11/23/more-small-business-start-up-links-to-check-out/feed/\n0\n5 Small Business Links Worth Reading (On Email, Search Rankings, and More)\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2012/10/25/5-small-business-links-worth-reading-on-email-search-rankings-and-more/\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2012/10/25/5-small-business-links-worth-reading-on-email-search-rankings-and-more/#comments\nThu, 25 Oct 2012 18:00:41 +0000\nRob Marsh\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/?p=2559\nEach week we stumble across lots of articles worth passing on to the many small business owners who visit Logomaker every day.

Out of all the great information, articles, and blog posts out there, here are a few we definitely think you should check out:\nFrom Website Magazine: Journey to the Top of the SERPs\n Key idea: \u201cBut the more telling information comes from looking at the clicks on organic results. Compete says that 53 percent of those clicks go to the top organic listing, and the number decreases significantly from there. The second link gets 15 percent of the clicks, while the third gets nine percent, the fourth sees six percent and the fifth is clicked on just four percent of the time.\u201d\nFrom ClickZ: 5 Tips to Empower Your Email Marketing\n Key Idea: \u201cEvery message you send and every open (and click) is a way for you to build up on your value proposition. Continue looking at branding, the consumer\u2019s attention span, and your ability to convert the consumer to a customer. Your biggest success would be driven by focusing on getting the consumer to trust you\u2026\u201d\nFrom MarketingProfs: What\u2019s the Best Time to Send Your Email?\n Key Idea: \u201cThe top engagement times for email are as follows: in the mornings, 8 AM to 9 AM both for opens and click-throughs; and in the afternoons, 3 PM to 8 PM for opens, and 3 PM and 4 PM for click-throughs.\u201d\nFrom QuickSprout: Why Content Marketing is the New SEO\n Key Idea: \u201cSEO isn\u2019t the same as what it used to be. You can\u2019t just popup an ugly website, throw up mediocre content, and build a few links and expect to rank well.\u201d\nFrom Jason Fried: Some Advice from Jeff Bezos\n Key Idea: \u201cpeople who were right a lot of the time were people who often changed their minds. He doesn\u2019t think consistency of thought is a particularly positive trait. It\u2019s perfectly healthy \u2014 encouraged, even \u2014 to have an idea tomorrow that contradicted your idea today.\u201d\nPhoto Credit: drp via photopin cc\nThe post 5 Small Business Links Worth Reading (On Email, Search Rankings, and More) appeared first on Logomaker Blog.]]>\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2012/10/25/5-small-business-links-worth-reading-on-email-search-rankings-and-more/feed/\n0\n5 Links Worth Reading\u2014On Small Business & Logo Design\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2012/10/18/5-links-worth-reading-on-small-business-logo-design/\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2012/10/18/5-links-worth-reading-on-small-business-logo-design/#comments\nThu, 18 Oct 2012 22:22:01 +0000\nRob Marsh\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/?p=2546\nWe strive to present interesting ideas and news in this blog for small business owners.

Along the way we come across a lot of great information on other websites. Today we\u2019ve collected a few that we\u2019ve liked recently on subjects like logo design and building your business. Check them out:\nFrom Marketing Profs: Your Brand Is More Than a Logo.\n Key idea: \u201cA logo is a vital element of how you communicate your brand. A logo is the visual representation of who and what you are. But your logo is just the beginning of your brand.\u201d\nFrom Seth Godin and EarWolf: StartUp School\n What it is: In this rare live recording, hear Seth as he guides thirty entrepreneurs through a workshop exploring how they can build and run their dream business. You can also find it on iTunes.\nFrom JJ Ramberg: 4 Essential Tips to Transform Your Small Business\n Key idea: \u201c\u2026for the past many years I\u2019ve been in this really lucky position of getting to interview people about how they\u2019re growing their business and then use those tips in my own company. Here are some of the things I\u2019ve learned along the way.\u201d\nFrom Forbes: Stop Futzing With Your Logo and Get Back to Work!\n Key idea: \u201cThis small business owner was guilty of focusing on a tangential issue (dated corporate identity graphics) rather than on the core issue: Is his business sustainably delivering on its brand promise? If so, the current logo represents something positive. If not, fixing the problems within the business is far more important than revising a logo.\u201d\nFrom SEOMoz: Getting On Page SEO Right\n Key idea: \u201cPeople abandon search results much more quickly than they used to. Rankings doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to the traffic. We see click-through rates sometimes on position two, three, or four being higher than on position one because something is more interesting about the listing.\u201d\nBonus Link (from the Logomaker Blog Archive): 20 Questions to Ask About Your Brand.\nPhoto Credit: Rigmarole via photopin cc\nThe post 5 Links Worth Reading\u2014On Small Business & Logo Design appeared first on Logomaker Blog.]]>\nhttp://www.logomaker.com/blog/2012/10/18/5-links-worth-reading-on-small-business-logo-design/feed/\n0",

      "text": "Zack Leman, Julian Huertas, Zach Albert, Bernie Clevens, Romeo Ibanez, Alden Drake, Brock Cassidy, Ivy Xing and Ruben Martinez\nTo encourage a stimulating exchange of ideas about launching new businesses, Alden Drake \u201915 and Romeo Ibanez \u201915 have formed an entrepreneurs\u2019 club on campus with the help of many other students and alumni.\n\u201cFor more than two hundred years, outstanding entrepreneurs have graduated from the College,\u201d Ibanez said. \u201cFrom the founder of one of the world\u2019s most important rating agencies, Standard and Poor\u2019s, to Reed Hastings\u2019s Netflix, Bowdoin\u2019s graduates have consistently revolutionized the world in every field that they have touched. \u2026 What Alden and I sought to do was something very simple: to provide a place for [future entrepreneurs] to begin learning about entrepreneurship.\u201d\nThe Bowdoin Entrepreneurship Club will both introduce students to entrepreneurial strategies and concepts, and encourage them to focus with like-minded students on one of four specific fields: retail, biotech, finance and web/hardware/social media. During meetings, students are encouraged to bounce start-up ideas off of one another.\n\u201cEach one of these groups is led by two to three student leaders, who are dedicated, easy to talk to and want to pursue these fields in the future,\u201d Drake said. \u201cRomeo and I could not do this without them.\u201d\nMeanwhile, each group has at least two alumni contacts who\u2019ve been in the field for at least six years. \u201cWe are trying to build a network of alumni and others who will help form this group and are willing to assist in any way they can,\u201d Drake said.\nBowdoin Trustee David Brown \u201979 and Sean Marsh \u201995 have agreed to be available as advisors to the group. \u201cI have a passion for Bowdoin and a passion for entrepreneurship,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cIf I can help both of these to grow symbiotically it is a no brainer for me. \u2026 Having a student organization that gives students a forum for learning and discussion around this topic and leverages the collective knowledge of the Bowdoin ecosystem (and beyond) strikes me as a worthwhile endeavor.\u201d\nDrake and Ibanez\u2019s entrepreneurial group has about 120 student members, not including the student leaders of the subcommittees: Zack Leman \u201915 and Ruben Martinez \u201915 in biotech; Zach Albert \u201916 and Julian Huertas \u201916 for nonprofit/retail; Ivy Xing \u201915 for web/social media; and Bernie Clevens \u201915 and Brock Cassidy \u201915 in finance.\nDrake said she and Ibanez want to encourage students to think as entrepreneurs but not to abandon their education. \u201cOur goal is not to leave college,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want them to feel safe and comfortable to talk about ideas, and see if they\u2019re worth pursuing.\u201d\nBrown said he believes college is a foundation for successful entrepreneurship. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed that in the end entrepreneurship is applied liberal arts,\u201d he said. \u201cBowdoin people are good leaders if they\u2019ve gone through the crucible and continue to be lifelong learners. \u2026 A lot of Bowdoin values can find expression in entrepreneurial fields.\u201d\nThe entrepreneurs\u2019 club will also bring speakers on campus who could speak about topics such as how to build business plans, when to approach venture capitalists or what it means to be entrepreneur. \u201cWe\u2019re slated to have Dr. Peter Drake shortly after returning from winter break,\u201d Ibanez said. \u201cBill Farley should be here in the middle of February and Kara Boudreau of JPMorgan Chase will be doing a joint presentation with her husband, Richard Hurd, who is the chief investment officer at Mayo Capital in March.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make a community,\u201d Drake said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to connect kids like us who want to talk about this stuff but don\u2019t know where to turn.\u201d",

I\u2019m Mike.\n[00:19] Rob: And I\u2019m Rob.\n[00:20] Mike: And we\u2019re here to share our experiences to help you avoid the same mistakes we\u2019ve made. So, what\u2019s the word this week, Rob?\n[00:24] Rob: Well, we just launched the HitTail Basecamp integration that I talked about last week. So it\u2019s all live. If you go to hittail.com/basecamp, you get a brief walk through, some screenshots of how that works. And I\u2019m pretty excited. Like I said, it\u2019s really \u2013 I\u2019ve mentioned it was the first integration we\u2019ve done but it\u2019s actually the second I realized because the first one was with kind of the \u2013 the one-click article service but that one was written by me. On this one my product manager really banged this one out and it\u2019s all architected well and I think I told you he wrote OAuth and OAuth Library in Classic ASP from scratch. I can\u2019t imagine. I wouldn\u2019t definitely not have been that just \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t have that coding forwarded to to sit down and do that. But anyways, we\u2019re excited, you know, we\u2019re both doing \u2013 going to start a little of bit promotion. We\u2019re kind of doing a soft launch right now. We\u2019d just want to get more people using it just to make sure it\u2019s all good and also have a little bit of paid acquisition with some HitTail and Basecamp stuff going on. So, it\u2019s pretty good. How about you?\n[01:17] Mike: Well, I have this new developer starting in a couple of weeks. I just kind of worked out some arrangements with him. We\u2019re going to try \u2013 we\u2019re going to try doing some stuff for about three weeks or so and see how it works out and then kind of reevaluate things from there. So, hopefully, that works out.\n[01:31] Rob: AuditShark?\n[01:31] Mike: He will be working on other stuff first and then if that \u2013 if everything works out, then probably transition him over to working on AuditShark.\n[01:38] Rob: Got it.\n[01:39] Mike: As I said, it\u2019s a trial period and we\u2019ll just see how it goes but I really need somebody who I can put on AuditShark to work on some of the core guts of it. I\u2019ve been working on a lot of this database synchronization code for AuditShark and I\u2019m about at the point where I can actually start testing it but I have all these to-do comments and they\u2019re like different events and things that should be logged. So, you know, some of them have security implications. Some of them just have synchronization implications and I haven\u2019t actually implemented any of the login code behind it and if I had to go look, there\u2019s probably close to a hundred places where I\u2019ve literally documented to do log this or, you know, to do make sure that you double check this data or et cetera. So, to be honest about it, it\u2019s not necessarily worth your time to be doing that. I mean there\u2019s other places that your time is better spent.\n[02:27] Rob: Right and that\u2019s the thing is, you know, my 12-year career writing software, I\u2019ve always gold plated everything especially as a consultant and working for \u2013 I was a salary employee for credit card company for years like you wrote things to the nines and so when I say I\u2019m a hack what I mean is a hack compared to that where I would spend weeks writing this, the single routine and testing every possible option and doing all kinds of stuff and I just don\u2019t do that anymore. Get kind of the minimum viable function out and then revisit it later. And the thing is that I can \u2013 I can just move so quickly, right? If there is actually a bug or any types of problem, I can go in and edit the stuff and it\u2019s not a \u2013 a 2-day process to get a change in to production like it used to be. So, it\u2019s more of taking advantage of your agility as a very small startup or a very small software company. You can really be much more, more fast moving than \u2013 than larger competitors. So, you have different pros and cons than a larger company maybe doing or building the same software.\n[03:21] Mike: Right, I mean there\u2019s just different priorities when you\u2019re working on stuff. That\u2019s really all it comes down to.\n[03:25] Rob: Well, hey, if you haven\u2019t checked out episode 36 of the Stock Exchange Podcast, it\u2019s definitely worth a listen. It retells in great detail their Hurricane Sandy story of logging those buckets of gasoline up the stairs after they lost power. We\u2019ve briefly mentioned it last week but I heard the episode. It\u2019s just to hear that kind of that, they had like eight or nine people on this podcast since it\u2019s a round table and they\u2019re just telling their story of, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s midnight on this day and then the power goes out and then you just\u2026\u201d One guy had a knife and another guy had a plastic vodka bottle that they cut the bottom out of and used as a funnel for the gas. I mean it was just so cool to hear the innovation and just the get it doneness of the entrepreneurs, right? They didn\u2019t sit around complaining. They just figured out how to make it work and how to log this gas up the thing to keep \u2013 it was Fog Creek Software and Square Space were the kind of the two people on this podcast. So, pretty \u2013 pretty cool story.\n[04:18] Mike: Yeah, that is cool. I haven\u2019t \u2013 I haven\u2019t had a chance to listen to it yet. I\u2019ve got some time up in New York and I\u2019m going to be spending down there again. So, I\u2019ve got a 3-hour drive back and forth and I definitely be listening to that though.\n[04:28] Rob: Nice, what else is going on?\n[04:29] Mike: Oh, you know what? I think that you had said that you tried the Facebook ads.\n[04:34] Rob: I did, indeed.\n[04:34] Mike: I\u2019m going to be doing that soon. My wife is kind of venturing out to actually start her own business at this point. She\u2019s going to be \u2013 she\u2019s a certified Zumba instructor. She\u2019s had enough people approached her to teach at different places that she has decided to kind of take the next step and start building up her own fitness company. She was asking me about how to not necessarily how to drive people to her, you know, to her classes and stuff but she\u2019s kind of talking about some of the issues that she\u2019s got with that, \u201cOh, well, I\u2019ve got to make sure that I have this number of people there and if I don\u2019t, then I either break even or lose money.\u201d And I just kind of offered to help her drive some people there and my first thought was, well this seems perfect for using Facebook ads.\n[05:15] Rob: Absolutely, I really agree. I think that\u2019s a good choice because it\u2019s definitely a consumer-type thing. Now, for people who don\u2019t know what Zumba is right \u2013\n[05:22] Mike: Yeah, it\u2019s kind of a dance fitness. There\u2019s kind of a Zumba fitness organization that oversees it and there\u2019s all these rules and regulations about how you can use their logo and brand and everything else. So, she can\u2019t have a brand name that says Zumba and or anything like that. But it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s very well tied to overall health and fitness and incorporates a lot of dance moves. So, she\u2019ll teach at Curves which \u2013 Curves is a fitness facility that is exclusively for women and she has to teach it like the YWCA and there\u2019s a couple of independent fitness studios around that she goes in to. So, she\u2019s been subbing for different classes and somebody had said, \u201cOh well, I can\u2019t do this class anymore. Can you do it or do you want to take it over?\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll take it over if you\u2019re not going to do it anymore but I kind of want control over everything at that point, you know, I\u2019m no longer going to be just doing it as a substitute.\u201d So, she\u2019s going to essentially expand from there.\n[06:14] Rob: That\u2019s cool. And Facebook is neat for geographically targeting like that. A mutual friend of ours was actually trying to relocate and his wife worked for a government agency that would only transfer her job if she could find someone at the new location to swap with her and so he went on to Facebook and targeted that location and that government agency because you can say people who work for \u2013\n[06:34] Mike: Oh \u2013\n[06:34] Rob: \u2026 and type it in. And so, he did that and was showing ads to like say, \u201cDo you want to move to X,\u201d you know, where they currently live and he got some people to come through. I don\u2019t know that he ever actually \u2013 if that\u2019s where they actually found the person or not but he definitely got inquiries and he just had a like a Google doc form or some, you know, e-mail link or something and people can drop a line. So, it\u2019s pretty cool with local stuff. It\u2019s super easy to target across a lot more demographics than any other system I\u2019ve ever seen.\n[07:02] Mike: Right. She was \u2013 she already has like a Facebook fan page set up that, you know, she\u2019s going on there and letting people know because one of the issues she has is if there aren\u2019t enough people attending that sometimes they have to cancel depending on the location, so, there are, you know, there\u2019s usually post that go out on Facebook that says, \u201cHey, if you \u2013 please RSVP or let us know if you\u2019re going to be able to make it tonight,\u201d and then they\u2019ll cancel class within like an hour so that people aren\u2019t driving there and then find out that it\u2019s canceled. And that was what she was thinking that she would be using Facebook for and I said, \u201cWell, you have access to or you can get access through the Facebook ad system to all the people in this geographic area and you can advertise explicitly to those people.\u201d And I don\u2019t think that was something she\u2019d ever really considered before and I don\u2019t think that any of other instructors she\u2019s worked with have done anything like that either. It would be interesting to see how that turns out.\n[07:49] Rob: I agree. Keep us posted. I want to give a shout out thanks to Andrea Conti [Phonetic]. He put together a detailed list of the podcasts that we mentioned in Episode 104 because I just had it as kind of a bulleted list and he put up all the links and he put it in to nice HTML table and so, that\u2019s now live in Episode 104 in the show notes. So, I\u2019d just wanted to thank him for that.\n[08:11] Music\n[08:14] Rob: So, Mike and I are very pleased to have with us today, Brennan Dunn. He\u2019s a long time Micropreneur Academy member. He also runs his own consulting firm, founder of Planscope and that\u2019s at planscope.io which is project management software for freelancers. It\u2019s a software service application. You know, he\u2019s also written an E-book for freelancers. He has a podcast. He does workshops, all kinds of stuff but before we get in to that, I wanted Brennan to say hi to everybody.\n[08:38] Brennan: Hey, everyone.\n[08:39] Rob: So, talk to us a little bit about just maybe a 1 or 2-minute intro kind of where you come from, what you\u2019ve been up to the last few years and how you found yourself launching Planscope, you know, having the E-book and workshop and everything.\n[08:49] Brennan: Sure, six years ago, I went out of my own became a freelancer. And a little over two years ago, I decided to grow a company. Well, really, I got it so much work than I really had to scale. I kind of went out on a whim and just decided to open up a brick and mortar consultancy. And we grew to ten people and it was a rush but really, I was bit by the product bug and I really wanted to escape consulting once and for all and just kind of build products that I owned and produced recurring revenue for me because consulting can be extremely draining. Yeah, so I decided to \u2013 really what happened first was I took Amy Hoy\u2019s 30\u00d7500 class and I also at the same time signed up for the Micropreneur Academy. So, I did my research. I discovered that there is a need for something like Planscope and I built it and launched it at LessConf last year, I believe last February.\n[09:43] And it\u2019s been growing pretty steadily but the problem with SaaS revenue is even at a 10% growth rate, when you started from zero, it\u2019s still going to take a while to kind of become really that profitable. So, basically I promoted somebody at the consultancy to run it in my absence and I\u2019ve been heads down on products ever since. And last summer, I released a book which in turn led me to managing a newsletter for freelancers and just recently I launched my first online workshop. So, all of it really appeals to the same audience, freelancers and they all kind of feed off to each other. So, that\u2019s kind of my last six years in the nutshell.\n[10:22] Rob: Very nice. So, your consultancy is still running kind of in the background, is that right?\n[10:27] Brennan: It is. Most of the people that used to work for me fulltime had now been converted back to independent contractors and the guy, Zack who used to lead business development, I really promoted him the COO and really, I get a once a week phone call with updates and how we\u2019re doing and everything else.\n[10:44] Rob: Very cool. So, you are very much working on your business not in your business, I would say.\n[10:49] Brennan: Correct.\n[10:49] Rob: We\u2019re going to be talking about moving from consulting to products and this is something that all three of us on this podcast here, you know, might have done or in the process of doing. And I think it\u2019s a very common path and even if folks are simply moving from salaried employment to products, it can often be, you know, a similar type of set up or you\u2019re just trying to buy out enough time, enough of your time to actually get an app off of the ground. And as you said, if you have a SaaS app, you do tend to need a pretty long runway in order to make it there. So, I guess the first question and you partially addressed this already but you mentioned that, you know, consulting obviously brings in good revenue. So, what is your motivation? Why do you \u2013 why do you thirst to own products?\n[11:32] Brennan: I think because I know a lot of product owners and I know that they are significantly happier than I ever was working 12 hours a day managing a consultancy, going through the churn of client after client and really having no ownership at the end of the day of anything I produced. So, products were always kind of, you know, the light at the end of the tunnel and people were paying me to build products for them. So, I had everything I needed to build my own. The problem of being that, you know, consulting like an illicit drug gives you an immediate benefit whereas products tend to take a little longer.\n[12:03] Rob: Right, so consulting is like an illicit drug and products are like exercise perhaps?\n[12:08] Brennan: [Laughter] Yeah, I\u2019ve always actually compared consulting to crack cocaine.\n[12:13] Rob: How about you, Mike? What are your thoughts?\n[12:15] Mike: It\u2019s really hard to breakaway from consulting once you\u2019re there though. I mean, I really admire what you\u2019ve done in terms of being able to be in a position to I\u2019ll say essentially walked away from that consulting business without having to pay attention to it because you had somebody there who you could rely on and essentially help maintain the business.\n[12:34] Rob: Yeah, for sure. I think I\u2019ve, you know, my thoughts on this as well as are similar to Brennan\u2019s and that I was always doing it for the lifestyle element but more for the freedom of it initially and I thought that once I have the freedom that, man, I would just totally be happy and it turns out that the freedom was part of that but I also needed to continue to have challenges as well and you know, I\u2019m certainly in the same boat as you, as you guys. So, the next question I have for you guys to throw on the table is after you realized, you know, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a consultant or even a salaried employee, what\u2019s the first step you recommend once someone has made that decision that they want to go all in and they want to move to building products and they want \u2013 essentially, I think, obviously, the first step is replacing their income but, you know, even before that like what do you think now that you guys are both, you know, in the midst of it, what would you recommend someone do?\n[13:19] Brennan: So, I\u2019ve seen a lot of consultants who try to enter to the product space and the ones that fail, end up treating their product really like a side project. What I realized earlier on was that if I wanted any of my products to actually succeed, I would really need to treat it like first-class client project, not I\u201dll deal when I have time or I really had to make sure that I dedicated two days a week to doing nothing but working on my product while spending the other three days really fulltime heads down on, you know, paying my own personal bills. Now, I\u2019ve kind of had it a little easier because in running the consultancy, my employees were paying my bills. So, made it a little easier to write Planscope but had I been a freelancer, it would have taken longer but the same outcome, hopefully, would have occurred.\n[14:04] Rob: Very nice, yeah, you definitely have the luxury of having that consulting and it isn\u2019t like something that was hand to. You had built the company but it certainly was a benefit to you when making that transition. For my perspective when I was transitioning from consulting and trying to replace that income with products, I was supporting the family. I had one child and a mortgage and the wife and she was an intern at the time. And so, I was consulting during the day and I was actually doing a lot of side work in the evenings and weekends to try to be able to work on my products. And so I hear what you\u2019re saying about having it work on the side is actually a big challenge and that tends to be a recipe for failure. Somehow I has able to make it work but it do take me several years obviously and a lot of failures to get there.\n[14:49] Mike: Well, I think that the way Brennan put it was a little bit differently than I would have thought of it where he said that he really has seen a lot of people failed because they don\u2019t treat their side projects as essentially a first-class citizen and you know, basically treated them as if it was consulting work that absolutely had to be done. And what I was going to say before he had said that was essentially talking about a mindset change because when you\u2019re doing consultant work, you get this immediate benefit from whatever it is that you\u2019re working on and you get paid by the hour on a weekly or monthly basis and there\u2019s a tangible reward that you know is going to be coming with the consulting work. When you\u2019re working on a product, you don\u2019t necessarily have that and it could be months or even years down the road before you start to make enough money that all of the time that you put in previously starts to pay off.\n[15:38] So, it\u2019s \u2013 if you\u2019ve been consulting for a long time, it\u2019s a serious challenge to get over that mental block that he just says, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m going to put some time in to this. I\u2019m going to put in 10, 20, 50 hours and I\u2019m not going to see any return or whatsoever for a very, very long period of time and I think that\u2019s just a mental block.\u201d But I think the way Brennan put it was extremely good and that you have to treat it as if it was a first-class citizen as if you are doing work for someone else and that it needs to get done.\n[16:05] Rob: Yeah, for sure. I think that was something within the first six months of starting to get some product revenue, I actually toned down my consulting hours right away and I knew that being able to do that with lend a lot of freedom. It will basically lend some acceleration to getting that, that product revenue going. Even when I was salary, like a couple of years earlier when I started having a little bit of revenue, I actually went down to part-time at one point, my salary job. So, we\u2019ve talked about that on the show before but I definitely think that that\u2019s something that people should \u2013 should consider. It\u2019s not an all or nothing game of working 40, 50 hours a week for an employer or clients and then only being able to work on the side on your app. There is an in between and it sounds like, you know, we all have different ways of achieving that.\n[16:47] So, I want to switch the discussion over to this thing that I\u2019m calling the stair step approach to replacing \u2013 essentially replacing your income and I\u2019ve mentioned that a couple of times because that\u2019s kind of the first goal. I feel like if you\u2019re a bootstrapper, you need to replace this income of, you know, your salary job or consulting. And a lot of people hunker down and try to build this big SaaS app and they want to make the big splash and you know, start generating that recurring revenue right away. But what I\u2019ve seen and the approach that I took and what I have actually seen a lot of people having success with is not relying on a single product and having some easy wins early on. So, either writing an E-book, having a WordPress plug-in, running a workshop like you\u2019re doing, Brennan, to fund some of your time so you\u2019re able to work harder and focus more on your longer term win like a SaaS app.\n[17:34] And so I had \u2013 I have crazy websites people have heard about like justbeachtowels.com where I, you know, I had beach towels that were being drop ship to people and I had a CMS theming service early on and I had some other information products that I don\u2019t even own anymore by there were my stair step products just to get that income replacements so that I had enough time to then really focus on this long-term goal of building the products with more longevity. You, Brennan, are already attacking that. Can you tell us a little bit about how that\u2019s worked and whether it was intentional or whether you\u2019ve just kind of, you know, stumbled in to having these multiple smaller products?\n[18:08] Brennan: Yes, so it\u2019s actually a pretty funny story. One of the misconceptions I think is that consultancies have a very high profit margin. It really tends to not to. So, now that I\u2019ve kind of given the reign to somebody else, the income from the consultancy isn\u2019t nearly what it used to be and what it used to be wasn\u2019t that significant either. The thing is Planscope right now we\u2019re kind of slowly growing it about 10% a month but that translates to maybe $400 a month in growth which isn\u2019t going to pay my mortgage and my kids\u2019 schools and everything else anytime soon.\n[18:35] So, I had two paths. I could go full steam consulting and really throw away a lot of hours because consulting, you spend an hour on a client project and that hour doesn\u2019t benefit your product or your audience at all. So, that was path one and path two which really came really accidentally I think. I had a bet with Amy Hoy where I really wanted to go to a conference in Ireland and we had some medical issues, you know, in the family and I didn\u2019t have anything budgeted to go and I know Planscope wasn\u2019t going to be able to give me the money I needed to do that. So, she convinced me to write a book. The book actually came pretty easily because I had developed really good relationships with my Planscope customers and determined that a lot of them were kind of unsure about to price their services.\n[19:19] So, I wrote a book. I collected pre-sales and I actually sold $6,000 in product before the book was done and since then, it sold another 25,000. Now, it\u2019s brought in 30 grand which I\u2019m pretty happy about considering that\u2019s nine months or eights months of Planscope at its current state\u2019s income. And then that actually led me to realize that there was a smaller need in the subset of people who wanted to learn me from me about building a consultancy. So, I up the ante and actually charge a thousand a seat. I sold 25 seats. That added another 25,000 to my runway of capital. So, the benefit overall I think of the second path is that all of this feeds in to each other.\n[20:02] So, I\u2019ve gotten Planscope customers who found my book because the book is much \u2013 it\u2019s hard to convince somebody to drop their current project management software and use yours but it\u2019s a lot easier to an impulse buy to get somebody to find your book and if your book is about \u2013 like mine is doubling your freelancing rate that\u2019s a quick and easy buy. They read the book. They either like or they don\u2019t like my philosophy on things, then or are much more willing to check out my other products because they like me. They like the mentality I have towards consulting. So, they all kind of worked out really well and it still is. I mean the book is still selling. The workshop is still selling and Planscope is still selling. So, the diversification for me at least has yielded a lot of returns.\n[20:42] Rob: Yeah, that\u2019s really cool to hear. I think we\u2019ve seen similar things with, you know, the podcast tying in to the Academy and tying in to MicroConf and then, you know, I wrote the book, my book on a similar subject, then I certainly see the same thing of there are just being a lot of crossover with people finding one and basically liking it enough that it kind of gets them in to your world. And if they respect the work that you do, it\u2019s pretty easy for them to then say, \u201cOh, well, I paid 19 bucks for a book. Next, I\u2019m able to actually invest a little more and maybe I even, you know, spend a thousand bucks and go \u2013 go to the conference and that happens in the next spring.\u201d\n[21:12] Music\n[21:15] Rob: So, our next topic is going to be talking about the pros and cons of moving to software products from consulting versus moving from a salary gig. And this is actually one thing that Mike and I get this question a lot from a lot of different people. It\u2019s a challenge. If you\u2019re working at a salary gig and you\u2019re really unhappy, the choice of moving directly in to products or moving first to consulting and trying to build that business enough to support you and then moving the products, it\u2019s a big question and it doesn\u2019t necessarily have a right or wrong answer but I want to throw that out there and kind of have \u2014 maybe Brennan, you can tackle it first and then Mike and I will give our thoughts as well.\n[21:49] Brennan: Sounds good. So, I haven\u2019t been a salaried employed for six years now. So, I really wouldn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to go from salary to products but what I do think is it\u2019s probably easier to go from consulting to products specifically because as a consultant, you really are a small business owner. And secondly, one of the really interesting things that came out of the workshop that I discovered was a lot of the students wanted to end up building products one day and a lot of them currently productize their consulted services. So, they might have different packages or these retainer agreements and they are already getting experience in pricing and how to market their services which I think is giving them a huge advantage when it comes to building what we might call traditional products, info products or software.\n[22:34] So, that\u2019s my thought on it. I think also one of the benefits that I think of being independent is you can kind of \u2013 it\u2019s almost like a scale. As your product revenue increases, you can then taper down your consulting time but likewise when you\u2019re just starting out, you\u2019re probably going to doing more consulting because you don\u2019t really have any product income to begin with and usually as an employee, you can\u2019t really \u2014 you\u2019re stuck nights and weekends usually to work on your side projects.\n[22:58] Rob: Right, it\u2019s a lot harder to taper, taper down your hours. What are your thoughts, Mike?\n[23:02] Mike: I think if somebody will come to me and ask my advice on whether they should jump from a salary gig in to consulting and then use that to leverage it in to products or just go straight in to the products, I probably advice them to go directly in the products. And I think the reason for that is more along the lines of when you\u2019re doing consulting especially if you don\u2019t have a subcontractor arrangement where work is essentially being handed to you at all times, then your focus tends to be divided. And by divided, I mean you\u2019re essentially trying to make sure that you have enough consulting work in order to make ends meet and if you don\u2019t, you have to work twice as hard at it. And that is very detrimental to being able to put \u2013 set aside time for working on your side project versus if you have a salaried engagement, you don\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s all these other stuff that you don\u2019t really have to think about. You can just say, \u201cOh, well, you know what? I\u2019ve got a couple of hours free. I can just work on my own product,\u201d versus if you are running your own consulting company and you\u2019re doing independent consulting, a lot of times you have to spend that extra time thinking about, \u201cWell, where is my next paycheck going to come from? Where is my next project going to come from?\u201d\n[24:10] And those things tend to get in the way. Now, there\u2019s definitely a benefit to running your own consulting company and getting the experience of running your own business. I could certainly see the benefits of trying to work through pricing and things like that and getting an external view of that because most of the time developers who are working in the company don\u2019t see like the sales and marketing sides and things like that. But I think that having that paycheck, that weekly paycheck that you don\u2019t really have to worry about where it comes from and being able to fall back on that, I think that\u2019s really, really beneficial.\n[24:41] Rob: I certainly see both \u2013 both sides of the coin. I think when \u2013 when I get this question, I say that if you\u2019re already consulting, it\u2019s a no brainer to keep doing that purely because of the freedom that you have and the timing flexibility and the ability to kind of to filter down your hours or funnel down your hours as Brennan said. But if \u2013 I think if you\u2019ve been a salaried employee for years and you\u2019ve never been a consultant, there\u2019s a lot to learn and that first three to six months that I tend to recommend people don\u2019t try to jump in to it because it\u2019s going to take them several months just to figure all their stuff out. New experiences of taxes, new experience of finding projects, managing projects, billing clients, making sure they get paid, you know, there\u2019s all that stuff. And once you\u2019ve been doing it for six months to a year, all that becomes a natural but it is a learning curve upfront.\n[25:24] And I also think that if your added job that doesn\u2019t have you working a ton of hours, that it\u2019s actually more beneficial like if you\u2019re working 30, 40 hours a week at a salaried gig and they\u2019re not pushing you to 70 or 80 and you\u2019ve been there for several years and you already have the clout and you kind of the trust of people, it actually gives you a lot of time to kind of go and decompress and work on stuff on the side. You know, there is kind of dependence on how your day gig actually is and how they actually treat you and if you do have the autonomy outside of it and you do have the mental space outside of it to devote to your product because certainly if you are working 70-hour a weeks and have you doing on the weekends, then my answer would be to put \u2013 potentially I have to find a different salary job or to move in the consulting from there.\n[26:06] Brennan: The last time I had a salary job, I was working 80 hours a week and there\u2019s just no way I had any mental energy left to do anything else. So, I think if I had a very cushy safe and secure job, then you\u2019re right. I think not needing to jilt with business development or anything is useful in a lot of ways. So, I think Mike actually has a really good point.\n[26:24] Rob: So, obviously, you\u2019ve had several successes both with your \u2013 your SaaS app that you\u2019re building up. You\u2019ve had a successful consultancy you\u2019ve built, your E-book, your workshop, are there any major missteps that you feel like you\u2019ve made along the way that other people would be likely to make?\n[26:39] Brennan: I know one thing that I made a huge mistake of and that was letting my initial Planscope mailing list got cold. When I initially tried to cross sell the new book to that list because I haven\u2019t literally spoken to them in months, the reception was not nearly what it should have been. You know, conversely I did keep my list warm for the book. If you buy the book, you get on my newsletter and I send three advices once a week which people seem to really like. Within hours when I announced the workshop and kind of ramped up anticipation about the workshop, I literally almost sold out the workshop within a few hours because the list was warm. That\u2019s one huge mistake that I made with Planscope because I didn\u2019t really understand the value of relationships outside of a user entry and a database.\n[27:23] Rob: Yeah, the power of that list is not to be trifled with. Mike, do you have any missteps?\n[27:30] Mike: Yeah, I mean the one that I kind of harp on that I ran in to was getting in to a consultant arrangement where you getting paid as contingent upon somebody else getting paid. That was more of a contract issue than anything else. Sign something and not really thinking about it and you know, they\u2019re like, \u201cWe\u2019ll pay you within seven days when we get paid by our customer.\u201d And that was just sounded great. Their customer doesn\u2019t pay them, then I\u2019ve got no recourse to go to them because they didn\u2019t get paid. And you know, I sat around for it was probably close to six months before I got 30 some thousand dollars in\u2013 invoice is straightened out.\n[28:02] Rob: Okay, well cool. Let\u2019s talk about myths and all that \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of startup advice out there and as soon as you start actually working on a product, working on a startup and launching something, having people use it. Instantly, some of that startup advice becomes essentially a myth in your mind because it\u2019s just not true, right? It maybe had been true with that person who said it, it may have been true for that person, but there are some common things like eating your on dog food, you must be part of your target audience, you know, build something people want and all these things that may or may not turn out to be true if you launch and have a different experience. Anything come to mind that once weren\u2019t true but now is nothing more than \u2013 or maybe a startup myth?\n[28:40] Brennan: So, I pointed out three different things that I used to believe and no longer believe. The first is that I used to believe that you realistically couldn\u2019t consult or do something else and bootstrap a product. There\u2019s a huge emphasis on you need to take outside money so you can stay focus 100% on your product and that I just think that\u2019s simply not true. I think you can \u2014 you can multitask. You can work on both. So, I mean again it\u2019s a slow growth, tortoise and hare type of raise but in the long run, I think it\u2019s better, at least for me than the alternative. The second thing that I think I\u2019ve come to realize is you really don\u2019t need a business co-founder. I\u2019m a developer. I\u2019m also a designer but when it comes to things like Planscope, I run support. I do all the marketing. I did blogging. I pretty much handle everything. No one else works on it with me and it might seem overwhelming but I\u2019m very partial to low risk easy win B2B products that I\u2019m not inventing new markets. I don\u2019t need to have some crazy viral win to grow their product. What I found is that when you take that route, when you focus on solving things that businesses have, I think it is manageable by one person.\n[29:48] So, my third myth finally and this is something that took me a while to realize is the myth that marketing is boring. I\u2019ve actually come to prefer doing split testing over writing code. I just think it\u2019s a lot more interesting. I mean it\u2019s almost like people hacking. I mean you\u2019re getting to see like how different variations are affecting things or \u2013 I recently redid my on boarding completely and I was able to see tangible financial results pretty immediately afterwards. That\u2019s the stuff that really is interesting to me and I used to think that the marketing side of thing that\u2019s left for a marketing department, you know. All I care about is code quality and craftsmanship and everything else which are important but I\u2019m really enjoying the traction affecting things of the job.\n[30:30] Rob: For sure. What I\u2019m seeing with entrepreneurs who are \u2014 developers who are transitioning to entrepreneurs and I did the same thing is you start by disliking the marketing just because we consider the four-letter word in the development world because if you\u2019ve ever worked with marketers, they\u2019re always a pain in the ass because they\u2019re always making you do stuff as a developer that you don\u2019t want to do, you don\u2019t understand what they want you to do. And so, first you start kind of your standoffish to it and then as you start learning it and you start to enjoy and see the \u2013 like you said, its people hacking, it\u2019s engineering of business. There\u2019s like all these different ways to look at it but once you get in to it, it becomes super addictive and I found that that entrepreneurs who \u2013 the bootstrappers who are actually making it happen, they eventually making the switch that you\u2019ve said where you actually enjoy the marketing perhaps more than writing code. Writing code is still fun. Writing code is your first love but this new thing, shiny and new and it gives you the financial immediate feedback that you don\u2019t get to see when you\u2019re sitting or hacking away and creating a new business object or new database table. So, I could \u2013 I can totally see that. How about you, Mike?\n[31:30] Mike: Well, I think Brennan talked about two of the three. I would have ordered them slightly differently. The first one was that you need the co-founder and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at all.\n[31:37] Rob: Right, you\u2019ve long been in time \u2013 you\u2019ve long been \u2013\n[31:38] Mike: [Laughter] Yeah, I\u2019ve long been an anti co-founder and it\u2019s not \u2013\n[31:40] Rob: Yeah.\n[31:41] Mike: And it\u2019s not really so much anti co-founder is that not having the right co-founder is probably worse than having no co-founder and that\u2019s really what it is. I just think that people really need to understand that you if you get involved with the wrong co-founder is infinitely worse than doing everything yourself. The second one is that you need funding in order to do anything interesting. I think that there\u2019s a lot of people out there who are doing some very, very interesting things that they just don\u2019t have funding for what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re all bootstrapped or they got things to a certain point on their own and then they decided that they wanted to go after funding and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything inherently wrong with funding but I think that there is this frequency of notion out there that you need funding in order to be successful and I just don\u2019t think that that\u2019s true.\n[32:20] The third one is that if you read a lot of the \u2013 the successful people out there, it seems easy and you ready everything they say that they, you know, they\u2019ll talk about some marketing technique or something like that and you kind of intuitively understand it. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, well, yeah, that makes sense. I would have done that.\u201d But you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have done that and what you come to realize is that those things aren\u2019t necessarily hard but they\u2019re time-consuming to learn and the reason that they\u2019re time-consuming to learn is because you make a series of missteps before you kind of stumble on the right idea and then in retrospect everything should have been obvious to you but it wasn\u2019t.\n[32:57] So it\u2019s just that things that should take a lot less time especially when you\u2019re getting in to the marketing side of things, they\u2019re going to take substantially more time than you think they will because you\u2019re going to have to go through those series of missteps before you really understand what\u2019s going on and it\u2019s only in looking back out of it that you understand.\n[33:15] Rob: Right, I think, I, too was a victim of reading the blogs back from about 2000 to maybe 2005 and it was \u2013 it was folks like Paul Graham, Eric Sink, Joel Spolsky and they talked about their startup days and they just sounded so awesome. It sounded just like this romantic vision of this peaceful villa where you\u2019re just typing way some code and launching some products and I was totally a victim. So and I don\u2019t think \u2013 certainly don\u2019t think that was intentional on their part but it\u2019s just you\u2019re not going to write a blog post about the stuff that\u2019s really boring and as it turns out, a lot of the stuff that we do [Laughter] is pretty darn boring. Don\u2019t know if I would call a myth but definitely a misunderstanding of mine early on.\n[33:51] Some folks say that you have to be a user of your app like you have to be the number one user that you have to build something that you will use. And well, I do think that is super helpful, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a necessity and I absolutely think you can build something in other niches for other people, you know, still the low hanging B2B bootstrap ideas I\u2019m a big fan of. But I still think you can have a lot of success with that even if you\u2019re not necessarily in the niche that you\u2019re building for.\n[34:15] Brennan: I think it can be harmful to you to build something that you\u2019re a little too passionate about. One of the things that I\u2019ve tried to get pretty good at is putting my ear to the ground and listening to what people are saying and what problems they have day to day. And I think that is significantly better than the alternative which is you\u2019re in the shower in the morning and a great idea comes to you and you go and build it. I think doing that kind of I won\u2019t say market research but just listening to what people are venting it out, that\u2019s where Planscope came from. I was basically crawling through internet forums for freelancers and I started from there.\n[34:50] Rob: Very cool. So, the next question I have is do you have one or two traits that you think are the most important for a successful founder now that you\u2019re kind of knee deep in it?\n[34:59] Mike: I think one of the single most important traits of a successful founder is perseverance and understanding that you are going to make mistakes and that\u2019s perfectly okay, you know. Nobody escapes from the business world completely unscathed. That just doesn\u2019t happen. There are people who get really lucky but they still make mistakes along the way and it\u2019s learning from those mistakes and adjusting and listening to what your customers are telling you that really makes a difference at the end of the day. You\u2019re not going to hit homerun on the first day. That\u2019s generally doesn\u2019t happen. You can do a lot of things right but you\u2019re still going to make a few minor mistakes along the way and overtime, the number of mistakes that you make is going to go down in certain areas and then as you start to thread new ground, you\u2019re going to learn new things. You\u2019re going to make mistakes in those areas and then you\u2019ll essentially adjust in those other areas as well. So, I think that perseverance and in the phase of uncertainty is really the single key trait that somebody has to have.\n[35:56] Rob: I think the willingness to fail and to actually go out with the intention of failing at a few things is important trait that I learned early on. I was just thinking about six months ago when \u2013 I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s about ten months ago, now when I relaunched HitTail I had this marketing plan and I put that in to a task list for myself and I was going to try about there are like 18 different marketing approaches, all different kinds of tactics. And I look at it and said, \u201cYou know, if 18 of this fail, and only 2 succeed, I am going to have a growing startup.\u201d I\u2019m actually going to have an app that works and even if 19 of them fail but 1 of them is like a huge success, you can get 10, 20, 30% growth a month in an early stage bootstrap startup with just a single \u2013 single successful marketing tactic. And it was actually in my head early on that most of them would fail but I need to try all of them.\n[36:48] One, to get the updated experience with them and two, because I love learning, I love trying new things. And three, because I just didn\u2019t know which one was going to work best and which one is going to drive the most traffic. And so running through all these things, I now have learned a ton about all of them and I know how this, you know, much brighter vision for what I can do both with HitTail and with future products that I have. So, I think that the willingness to go out there and to take some risks and to bet both some money and some time. And it\u2019s not betting the farm on any of these single approaches but it\u2019s vesting some money and some time and learning from that and being able to take that knowledge and then invest, you know, as you move forward.\n[37:24] Brennan: Yes, I would point out cadence as being an important trait which goes along with what both of you were just talking about and what I mean by cadence is knowing that in order to be successful, it\u2019s going to be a lot of very small victories or a lot of very small steps. And I see a lot of founders who they go away in to a basement and write a product almost in secret. They have this idea of this grand launch day. They launch it and crickets and then they get discourage and fades away. I\u2019ve always been a big, big advocate of really a thousand launches, right? I never really saw my launch day as being anything really that significant except that now I had an avenue for getting paying customers in the door.\n[38:08] But there is nothing spectacular on my launch day and I think you read TechCrunch or these different publications and you hear about these grand launches and people adding millions of users overnight. Like I think I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s a long tail game. It\u2019s steady march. It\u2019s a cadence. It\u2019s \u2013 I do my, you know, continual amount of blogging and producing content that helps me with my organic visibility where I slowly build out new features base on what my customers are actually asking for instead of thinking it as all or nothing way of looking at things.\n[38:40] Rob: Right, as Dan Anders would say, \u201cIt\u2019s playing long ball.\u201d\n[38:43] Brennan:Right.\n[38:44] Rob: All right, so I\u2019m going to wrap this up with one final question and I\u2019m actually interested in hearing everyone\u2019s thoughts on this. We\u2019ll start with Brennan, where do you see your business or businesses one year from now? What do you envision?\n[38:57] Brennan: I will probably have another book out because there has been, again, I kind of mind my customer correspondents to figure out what problems people have and they try to see between the lines and what I could offer to them, you know, initially. In a year I would like to fully live off a combination of my products and I would also like to really optimize. I would like to have a very grand funnel that works across all of my products and makes the transition between each product very seamless because the way it\u2019s working now is all of my products really target a single audience. If I can pull that off, that will obviously help my growth of my sales which will, hopefully, get me even closer to cutting the cord on consulting.\n[39:41] Rob: Very nice. How about you, Mike, where do you see yourself with AuditShark, Altiris Training, forum software, what else you have going on?\n[39:50] Mike: [Laughter] Well \u2013\n[39:50] Rob: Where do you see that in a year?\n[39:51] Mike: Oh, on top of that, I will probably have published a book in about a year. So \u2013\n[39:55] Rob: There \u2013\n[39:55] Mike: There\u2019s a spoiler alert.\n[39:56] Brennan: [Laughter]\n[39:56] Rob: First announcement. Very cool!\n[39:57] Mike: Yup, yup.\n[39:58] Mike: I anticipate being completely wind off from a consulting probably within twelve months. I don\u2019t know how quickly that\u2019s going to go but I, you know, obviously have a lot of different things going on right now and it\u2019s a matter of kind of figuring out which ones are working, which ones aren\u2019t. I have probably three or four different things that are I\u2019m obviously juggling at the moment. Between all of them, I\u2019m just going to be figuring out what one works and which one doesn\u2019t and then, you know, putting some extra effort in to the things that are working, hopefully, leveraging some partnerships that I\u2019ve been working with people on and you know, like I said just getting on a consulting. That\u2019s kind of my main focus for, you know, the next six to eight months.\n[40:34] Rob: On my end, I anticipate or hope, however you like to say it, that HitTail will be a two at least 2X where it is today and with a potentially to be it about 3X it means growing at a pretty nice cliff right now. And I have a product manager in place that I\u2019ve mentioned a few times and he\u2019s taking on more and more responsibilities. So, over the next three to six months, I expected transition in to another product. More updates on that in the future.\n[41:03] Brennan: Nice.\n[41:04] Rob: Well, Brennan, thank you very much for coming on the program. We really appreciate your time in lending your insight. You know, someone who\u2019s knee deep in this process of transitioning from consulting to products, I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s a lot of folks in the audience who identify with where you\u2019re at inside this. I certainly appreciate it. If people want to get in touch with you, learn more about you, what\u2019s kind of the number one place they can go to get \u2013 maybe get in touch with you or just read more about your trials and tribulations?\n[41:28] Brennan: So, my \u2013 the Planscope blog has most of \u2013 I blog extensively and I do this because I\u2019ve realized that for me at least Hacker News can be a pretty good source of new business and I\u2019ve put up quite a few different blog post about \u2013 well, I\u2019m very open and transparent with my numbers. Well \u2013 I\u2019ll detail on boarding experiments and the results of that or one of the more recent ones was about how I built up this runaway of cash through these different products. planscope.io/blog is where you\u2019ll find a lot of my writing. You can e-mail me at me@brennandunn.com or I\u2019m on Twitter @BrennanDunn, B-R-E-N-N-A-N D-U-N-N.\n[42:08] Rob: Well, very good.

I\u2019m Mike.\n[00:19] Rob: And I\u2019m Rob.\n[00:20] Mike: And we\u2019re here to share our experiences to help you avoid the same mistakes we\u2019ve made. So, what\u2019s the word this week, Rob?\n[00:24] Rob: Well, we just launched the HitTail Basecamp integration that I talked about last week. So it\u2019s all live. If you go to hittail.com/basecamp, you get a brief walk through, some screenshots of how that works. And I\u2019m pretty excited. Like I said, it\u2019s really \u2013 I\u2019ve mentioned it was the first integration we\u2019ve done but it\u2019s actually the second I realized because the first one was with kind of the \u2013 the one-click article service but that one was written by me. On this one my product manager really banged this one out and it\u2019s all architected well and I think I told you he wrote OAuth and OAuth Library in Classic ASP from scratch. I can\u2019t imagine. I wouldn\u2019t definitely not have been that just \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t have that coding forwarded to to sit down and do that. But anyways, we\u2019re excited, you know, we\u2019re both doing \u2013 going to start a little of bit promotion. We\u2019re kind of doing a soft launch right now. We\u2019d just want to get more people using it just to make sure it\u2019s all good and also have a little bit of paid acquisition with some HitTail and Basecamp stuff going on. So, it\u2019s pretty good. How about you?\n[01:17] Mike: Well, I have this new developer starting in a couple of weeks. I just kind of worked out some arrangements with him. We\u2019re going to try \u2013 we\u2019re going to try doing some stuff for about three weeks or so and see how it works out and then kind of reevaluate things from there. So, hopefully, that works out.\n[01:31] Rob: AuditShark?\n[01:31] Mike: He will be working on other stuff first and then if that \u2013 if everything works out, then probably transition him over to working on AuditShark.\n[01:38] Rob: Got it.\n[01:39] Mike: As I said, it\u2019s a trial period and we\u2019ll just see how it goes but I really need somebody who I can put on AuditShark to work on some of the core guts of it. I\u2019ve been working on a lot of this database synchronization code for AuditShark and I\u2019m about at the point where I can actually start testing it but I have all these to-do comments and they\u2019re like different events and things that should be logged. So, you know, some of them have security implications. Some of them just have synchronization implications and I haven\u2019t actually implemented any of the login code behind it and if I had to go look, there\u2019s probably close to a hundred places where I\u2019ve literally documented to do log this or, you know, to do make sure that you double check this data or et cetera. So, to be honest about it, it\u2019s not necessarily worth your time to be doing that. I mean there\u2019s other places that your time is better spent.\n[02:27] Rob: Right and that\u2019s the thing is, you know, my 12-year career writing software, I\u2019ve always gold plated everything especially as a consultant and working for \u2013 I was a salary employee for credit card company for years like you wrote things to the nines and so when I say I\u2019m a hack what I mean is a hack compared to that where I would spend weeks writing this, the single routine and testing every possible option and doing all kinds of stuff and I just don\u2019t do that anymore. Get kind of the minimum viable function out and then revisit it later. And the thing is that I can \u2013 I can just move so quickly, right? If there is actually a bug or any types of problem, I can go in and edit the stuff and it\u2019s not a \u2013 a 2-day process to get a change in to production like it used to be. So, it\u2019s more of taking advantage of your agility as a very small startup or a very small software company. You can really be much more, more fast moving than \u2013 than larger competitors. So, you have different pros and cons than a larger company maybe doing or building the same software.\n[03:21] Mike: Right, I mean there\u2019s just different priorities when you\u2019re working on stuff. That\u2019s really all it comes down to.\n[03:25] Rob: Well, hey, if you haven\u2019t checked out episode 36 of the Stock Exchange Podcast, it\u2019s definitely worth a listen. It retells in great detail their Hurricane Sandy story of logging those buckets of gasoline up the stairs after they lost power. We\u2019ve briefly mentioned it last week but I heard the episode. It\u2019s just to hear that kind of that, they had like eight or nine people on this podcast since it\u2019s a round table and they\u2019re just telling their story of, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s midnight on this day and then the power goes out and then you just\u2026\u201d One guy had a knife and another guy had a plastic vodka bottle that they cut the bottom out of and used as a funnel for the gas. I mean it was just so cool to hear the innovation and just the get it doneness of the entrepreneurs, right? They didn\u2019t sit around complaining. They just figured out how to make it work and how to log this gas up the thing to keep \u2013 it was Fog Creek Software and Square Space were the kind of the two people on this podcast. So, pretty \u2013 pretty cool story.\n[04:18] Mike: Yeah, that is cool. I haven\u2019t \u2013 I haven\u2019t had a chance to listen to it yet. I\u2019ve got some time up in New York and I\u2019m going to be spending down there again. So, I\u2019ve got a 3-hour drive back and forth and I definitely be listening to that though.\n[04:28] Rob: Nice, what else is going on?\n[04:29] Mike: Oh, you know what? I think that you had said that you tried the Facebook ads.\n[04:34] Rob: I did, indeed.\n[04:34] Mike: I\u2019m going to be doing that soon. My wife is kind of venturing out to actually start her own business at this point. She\u2019s going to be \u2013 she\u2019s a certified Zumba instructor. She\u2019s had enough people approached her to teach at different places that she has decided to kind of take the next step and start building up her own fitness company. She was asking me about how to not necessarily how to drive people to her, you know, to her classes and stuff but she\u2019s kind of talking about some of the issues that she\u2019s got with that, \u201cOh, well, I\u2019ve got to make sure that I have this number of people there and if I don\u2019t, then I either break even or lose money.\u201d And I just kind of offered to help her drive some people there and my first thought was, well this seems perfect for using Facebook ads.\n[05:15] Rob: Absolutely, I really agree. I think that\u2019s a good choice because it\u2019s definitely a consumer-type thing. Now, for people who don\u2019t know what Zumba is right \u2013\n[05:22] Mike: Yeah, it\u2019s kind of a dance fitness. There\u2019s kind of a Zumba fitness organization that oversees it and there\u2019s all these rules and regulations about how you can use their logo and brand and everything else. So, she can\u2019t have a brand name that says Zumba and or anything like that. But it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s very well tied to overall health and fitness and incorporates a lot of dance moves. So, she\u2019ll teach at Curves which \u2013 Curves is a fitness facility that is exclusively for women and she has to teach it like the YWCA and there\u2019s a couple of independent fitness studios around that she goes in to. So, she\u2019s been subbing for different classes and somebody had said, \u201cOh well, I can\u2019t do this class anymore. Can you do it or do you want to take it over?\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll take it over if you\u2019re not going to do it anymore but I kind of want control over everything at that point, you know, I\u2019m no longer going to be just doing it as a substitute.\u201d So, she\u2019s going to essentially expand from there.\n[06:14] Rob: That\u2019s cool. And Facebook is neat for geographically targeting like that. A mutual friend of ours was actually trying to relocate and his wife worked for a government agency that would only transfer her job if she could find someone at the new location to swap with her and so he went on to Facebook and targeted that location and that government agency because you can say people who work for \u2013\n[06:34] Mike: Oh \u2013\n[06:34] Rob: \u2026 and type it in. And so, he did that and was showing ads to like say, \u201cDo you want to move to X,\u201d you know, where they currently live and he got some people to come through. I don\u2019t know that he ever actually \u2013 if that\u2019s where they actually found the person or not but he definitely got inquiries and he just had a like a Google doc form or some, you know, e-mail link or something and people can drop a line. So, it\u2019s pretty cool with local stuff. It\u2019s super easy to target across a lot more demographics than any other system I\u2019ve ever seen.\n[07:02] Mike: Right. She was \u2013 she already has like a Facebook fan page set up that, you know, she\u2019s going on there and letting people know because one of the issues she has is if there aren\u2019t enough people attending that sometimes they have to cancel depending on the location, so, there are, you know, there\u2019s usually post that go out on Facebook that says, \u201cHey, if you \u2013 please RSVP or let us know if you\u2019re going to be able to make it tonight,\u201d and then they\u2019ll cancel class within like an hour so that people aren\u2019t driving there and then find out that it\u2019s canceled. And that was what she was thinking that she would be using Facebook for and I said, \u201cWell, you have access to or you can get access through the Facebook ad system to all the people in this geographic area and you can advertise explicitly to those people.\u201d And I don\u2019t think that was something she\u2019d ever really considered before and I don\u2019t think that any of other instructors she\u2019s worked with have done anything like that either. It would be interesting to see how that turns out.\n[07:49] Rob: I agree. Keep us posted. I want to give a shout out thanks to Andrea Conti [Phonetic]. He put together a detailed list of the podcasts that we mentioned in Episode 104 because I just had it as kind of a bulleted list and he put up all the links and he put it in to nice HTML table and so, that\u2019s now live in Episode 104 in the show notes. So, I\u2019d just wanted to thank him for that.\n[08:11] Music\n[08:14] Rob: So, Mike and I are very pleased to have with us today, Brennan Dunn. He\u2019s a long time Micropreneur Academy member. He also runs his own consulting firm, founder of Planscope and that\u2019s at planscope.io which is project management software for freelancers. It\u2019s a software service application. You know, he\u2019s also written an E-book for freelancers. He has a podcast. He does workshops, all kinds of stuff but before we get in to that, I wanted Brennan to say hi to everybody.\n[08:38] Brennan: Hey, everyone.\n[08:39] Rob: So, talk to us a little bit about just maybe a 1 or 2-minute intro kind of where you come from, what you\u2019ve been up to the last few years and how you found yourself launching Planscope, you know, having the E-book and workshop and everything.\n[08:49] Brennan: Sure, six years ago, I went out of my own became a freelancer. And a little over two years ago, I decided to grow a company. Well, really, I got it so much work than I really had to scale. I kind of went out on a whim and just decided to open up a brick and mortar consultancy. And we grew to ten people and it was a rush but really, I was bit by the product bug and I really wanted to escape consulting once and for all and just kind of build products that I owned and produced recurring revenue for me because consulting can be extremely draining. Yeah, so I decided to \u2013 really what happened first was I took Amy Hoy\u2019s 30\u00d7500 class and I also at the same time signed up for the Micropreneur Academy. So, I did my research. I discovered that there is a need for something like Planscope and I built it and launched it at LessConf last year, I believe last February.\n[09:43] And it\u2019s been growing pretty steadily but the problem with SaaS revenue is even at a 10% growth rate, when you started from zero, it\u2019s still going to take a while to kind of become really that profitable. So, basically I promoted somebody at the consultancy to run it in my absence and I\u2019ve been heads down on products ever since. And last summer, I released a book which in turn led me to managing a newsletter for freelancers and just recently I launched my first online workshop. So, all of it really appeals to the same audience, freelancers and they all kind of feed off to each other. So, that\u2019s kind of my last six years in the nutshell.\n[10:22] Rob: Very nice. So, your consultancy is still running kind of in the background, is that right?\n[10:27] Brennan: It is. Most of the people that used to work for me fulltime had now been converted back to independent contractors and the guy, Zack who used to lead business development, I really promoted him the COO and really, I get a once a week phone call with updates and how we\u2019re doing and everything else.\n[10:44] Rob: Very cool. So, you are very much working on your business not in your business, I would say.\n[10:49] Brennan: Correct.\n[10:49] Rob: We\u2019re going to be talking about moving from consulting to products and this is something that all three of us on this podcast here, you know, might have done or in the process of doing. And I think it\u2019s a very common path and even if folks are simply moving from salaried employment to products, it can often be, you know, a similar type of set up or you\u2019re just trying to buy out enough time, enough of your time to actually get an app off of the ground. And as you said, if you have a SaaS app, you do tend to need a pretty long runway in order to make it there. So, I guess the first question and you partially addressed this already but you mentioned that, you know, consulting obviously brings in good revenue. So, what is your motivation? Why do you \u2013 why do you thirst to own products?\n[11:32] Brennan: I think because I know a lot of product owners and I know that they are significantly happier than I ever was working 12 hours a day managing a consultancy, going through the churn of client after client and really having no ownership at the end of the day of anything I produced. So, products were always kind of, you know, the light at the end of the tunnel and people were paying me to build products for them. So, I had everything I needed to build my own. The problem of being that, you know, consulting like an illicit drug gives you an immediate benefit whereas products tend to take a little longer.\n[12:03] Rob: Right, so consulting is like an illicit drug and products are like exercise perhaps?\n[12:08] Brennan: [Laughter] Yeah, I\u2019ve always actually compared consulting to crack cocaine.\n[12:13] Rob: How about you, Mike? What are your thoughts?\n[12:15] Mike: It\u2019s really hard to breakaway from consulting once you\u2019re there though. I mean, I really admire what you\u2019ve done in terms of being able to be in a position to I\u2019ll say essentially walked away from that consulting business without having to pay attention to it because you had somebody there who you could rely on and essentially help maintain the business.\n[12:34] Rob: Yeah, for sure. I think I\u2019ve, you know, my thoughts on this as well as are similar to Brennan\u2019s and that I was always doing it for the lifestyle element but more for the freedom of it initially and I thought that once I have the freedom that, man, I would just totally be happy and it turns out that the freedom was part of that but I also needed to continue to have challenges as well and you know, I\u2019m certainly in the same boat as you, as you guys. So, the next question I have for you guys to throw on the table is after you realized, you know, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a consultant or even a salaried employee, what\u2019s the first step you recommend once someone has made that decision that they want to go all in and they want to move to building products and they want \u2013 essentially, I think, obviously, the first step is replacing their income but, you know, even before that like what do you think now that you guys are both, you know, in the midst of it, what would you recommend someone do?\n[13:19] Brennan: So, I\u2019ve seen a lot of consultants who try to enter to the product space and the ones that fail, end up treating their product really like a side project. What I realized earlier on was that if I wanted any of my products to actually succeed, I would really need to treat it like first-class client project, not I\u201dll deal when I have time or I really had to make sure that I dedicated two days a week to doing nothing but working on my product while spending the other three days really fulltime heads down on, you know, paying my own personal bills. Now, I\u2019ve kind of had it a little easier because in running the consultancy, my employees were paying my bills. So, made it a little easier to write Planscope but had I been a freelancer, it would have taken longer but the same outcome, hopefully, would have occurred.\n[14:04] Rob: Very nice, yeah, you definitely have the luxury of having that consulting and it isn\u2019t like something that was hand to. You had built the company but it certainly was a benefit to you when making that transition. For my perspective when I was transitioning from consulting and trying to replace that income with products, I was supporting the family. I had one child and a mortgage and the wife and she was an intern at the time. And so, I was consulting during the day and I was actually doing a lot of side work in the evenings and weekends to try to be able to work on my products. And so I hear what you\u2019re saying about having it work on the side is actually a big challenge and that tends to be a recipe for failure. Somehow I has able to make it work but it do take me several years obviously and a lot of failures to get there.\n[14:49] Mike: Well, I think that the way Brennan put it was a little bit differently than I would have thought of it where he said that he really has seen a lot of people failed because they don\u2019t treat their side projects as essentially a first-class citizen and you know, basically treated them as if it was consulting work that absolutely had to be done. And what I was going to say before he had said that was essentially talking about a mindset change because when you\u2019re doing consultant work, you get this immediate benefit from whatever it is that you\u2019re working on and you get paid by the hour on a weekly or monthly basis and there\u2019s a tangible reward that you know is going to be coming with the consulting work. When you\u2019re working on a product, you don\u2019t necessarily have that and it could be months or even years down the road before you start to make enough money that all of the time that you put in previously starts to pay off.\n[15:38] So, it\u2019s \u2013 if you\u2019ve been consulting for a long time, it\u2019s a serious challenge to get over that mental block that he just says, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m going to put some time in to this. I\u2019m going to put in 10, 20, 50 hours and I\u2019m not going to see any return or whatsoever for a very, very long period of time and I think that\u2019s just a mental block.\u201d But I think the way Brennan put it was extremely good and that you have to treat it as if it was a first-class citizen as if you are doing work for someone else and that it needs to get done.\n[16:05] Rob: Yeah, for sure. I think that was something within the first six months of starting to get some product revenue, I actually toned down my consulting hours right away and I knew that being able to do that with lend a lot of freedom. It will basically lend some acceleration to getting that, that product revenue going. Even when I was salary, like a couple of years earlier when I started having a little bit of revenue, I actually went down to part-time at one point, my salary job. So, we\u2019ve talked about that on the show before but I definitely think that that\u2019s something that people should \u2013 should consider. It\u2019s not an all or nothing game of working 40, 50 hours a week for an employer or clients and then only being able to work on the side on your app. There is an in between and it sounds like, you know, we all have different ways of achieving that.\n[16:47] So, I want to switch the discussion over to this thing that I\u2019m calling the stair step approach to replacing \u2013 essentially replacing your income and I\u2019ve mentioned that a couple of times because that\u2019s kind of the first goal. I feel like if you\u2019re a bootstrapper, you need to replace this income of, you know, your salary job or consulting. And a lot of people hunker down and try to build this big SaaS app and they want to make the big splash and you know, start generating that recurring revenue right away. But what I\u2019ve seen and the approach that I took and what I have actually seen a lot of people having success with is not relying on a single product and having some easy wins early on. So, either writing an E-book, having a WordPress plug-in, running a workshop like you\u2019re doing, Brennan, to fund some of your time so you\u2019re able to work harder and focus more on your longer term win like a SaaS app.\n[17:34] And so I had \u2013 I have crazy websites people have heard about like justbeachtowels.com where I, you know, I had beach towels that were being drop ship to people and I had a CMS theming service early on and I had some other information products that I don\u2019t even own anymore by there were my stair step products just to get that income replacements so that I had enough time to then really focus on this long-term goal of building the products with more longevity. You, Brennan, are already attacking that. Can you tell us a little bit about how that\u2019s worked and whether it was intentional or whether you\u2019ve just kind of, you know, stumbled in to having these multiple smaller products?\n[18:08] Brennan: Yes, so it\u2019s actually a pretty funny story. One of the misconceptions I think is that consultancies have a very high profit margin. It really tends to not to. So, now that I\u2019ve kind of given the reign to somebody else, the income from the consultancy isn\u2019t nearly what it used to be and what it used to be wasn\u2019t that significant either. The thing is Planscope right now we\u2019re kind of slowly growing it about 10% a month but that translates to maybe $400 a month in growth which isn\u2019t going to pay my mortgage and my kids\u2019 schools and everything else anytime soon.\n[18:35] So, I had two paths. I could go full steam consulting and really throw away a lot of hours because consulting, you spend an hour on a client project and that hour doesn\u2019t benefit your product or your audience at all. So, that was path one and path two which really came really accidentally I think. I had a bet with Amy Hoy where I really wanted to go to a conference in Ireland and we had some medical issues, you know, in the family and I didn\u2019t have anything budgeted to go and I know Planscope wasn\u2019t going to be able to give me the money I needed to do that. So, she convinced me to write a book. The book actually came pretty easily because I had developed really good relationships with my Planscope customers and determined that a lot of them were kind of unsure about to price their services.\n[19:19] So, I wrote a book. I collected pre-sales and I actually sold $6,000 in product before the book was done and since then, it sold another 25,000. Now, it\u2019s brought in 30 grand which I\u2019m pretty happy about considering that\u2019s nine months or eights months of Planscope at its current state\u2019s income. And then that actually led me to realize that there was a smaller need in the subset of people who wanted to learn me from me about building a consultancy. So, I up the ante and actually charge a thousand a seat. I sold 25 seats. That added another 25,000 to my runway of capital. So, the benefit overall I think of the second path is that all of this feeds in to each other.\n[20:02] So, I\u2019ve gotten Planscope customers who found my book because the book is much \u2013 it\u2019s hard to convince somebody to drop their current project management software and use yours but it\u2019s a lot easier to an impulse buy to get somebody to find your book and if your book is about \u2013 like mine is doubling your freelancing rate that\u2019s a quick and easy buy. They read the book. They either like or they don\u2019t like my philosophy on things, then or are much more willing to check out my other products because they like me. They like the mentality I have towards consulting. So, they all kind of worked out really well and it still is. I mean the book is still selling. The workshop is still selling and Planscope is still selling. So, the diversification for me at least has yielded a lot of returns.\n[20:42] Rob: Yeah, that\u2019s really cool to hear. I think we\u2019ve seen similar things with, you know, the podcast tying in to the Academy and tying in to MicroConf and then, you know, I wrote the book, my book on a similar subject, then I certainly see the same thing of there are just being a lot of crossover with people finding one and basically liking it enough that it kind of gets them in to your world. And if they respect the work that you do, it\u2019s pretty easy for them to then say, \u201cOh, well, I paid 19 bucks for a book. Next, I\u2019m able to actually invest a little more and maybe I even, you know, spend a thousand bucks and go \u2013 go to the conference and that happens in the next spring.\u201d\n[21:12] Music\n[21:15] Rob: So, our next topic is going to be talking about the pros and cons of moving to software products from consulting versus moving from a salary gig. And this is actually one thing that Mike and I get this question a lot from a lot of different people. It\u2019s a challenge. If you\u2019re working at a salary gig and you\u2019re really unhappy, the choice of moving directly in to products or moving first to consulting and trying to build that business enough to support you and then moving the products, it\u2019s a big question and it doesn\u2019t necessarily have a right or wrong answer but I want to throw that out there and kind of have \u2014 maybe Brennan, you can tackle it first and then Mike and I will give our thoughts as well.\n[21:49] Brennan: Sounds good. So, I haven\u2019t been a salaried employed for six years now. So, I really wouldn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to go from salary to products but what I do think is it\u2019s probably easier to go from consulting to products specifically because as a consultant, you really are a small business owner. And secondly, one of the really interesting things that came out of the workshop that I discovered was a lot of the students wanted to end up building products one day and a lot of them currently productize their consulted services. So, they might have different packages or these retainer agreements and they are already getting experience in pricing and how to market their services which I think is giving them a huge advantage when it comes to building what we might call traditional products, info products or software.\n[22:34] So, that\u2019s my thought on it. I think also one of the benefits that I think of being independent is you can kind of \u2013 it\u2019s almost like a scale. As your product revenue increases, you can then taper down your consulting time but likewise when you\u2019re just starting out, you\u2019re probably going to doing more consulting because you don\u2019t really have any product income to begin with and usually as an employee, you can\u2019t really \u2014 you\u2019re stuck nights and weekends usually to work on your side projects.\n[22:58] Rob: Right, it\u2019s a lot harder to taper, taper down your hours. What are your thoughts, Mike?\n[23:02] Mike: I think if somebody will come to me and ask my advice on whether they should jump from a salary gig in to consulting and then use that to leverage it in to products or just go straight in to the products, I probably advice them to go directly in the products. And I think the reason for that is more along the lines of when you\u2019re doing consulting especially if you don\u2019t have a subcontractor arrangement where work is essentially being handed to you at all times, then your focus tends to be divided. And by divided, I mean you\u2019re essentially trying to make sure that you have enough consulting work in order to make ends meet and if you don\u2019t, you have to work twice as hard at it. And that is very detrimental to being able to put \u2013 set aside time for working on your side project versus if you have a salaried engagement, you don\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s all these other stuff that you don\u2019t really have to think about. You can just say, \u201cOh, well, you know what? I\u2019ve got a couple of hours free. I can just work on my own product,\u201d versus if you are running your own consulting company and you\u2019re doing independent consulting, a lot of times you have to spend that extra time thinking about, \u201cWell, where is my next paycheck going to come from? Where is my next project going to come from?\u201d\n[24:10] And those things tend to get in the way. Now, there\u2019s definitely a benefit to running your own consulting company and getting the experience of running your own business. I could certainly see the benefits of trying to work through pricing and things like that and getting an external view of that because most of the time developers who are working in the company don\u2019t see like the sales and marketing sides and things like that. But I think that having that paycheck, that weekly paycheck that you don\u2019t really have to worry about where it comes from and being able to fall back on that, I think that\u2019s really, really beneficial.\n[24:41] Rob: I certainly see both \u2013 both sides of the coin. I think when \u2013 when I get this question, I say that if you\u2019re already consulting, it\u2019s a no brainer to keep doing that purely because of the freedom that you have and the timing flexibility and the ability to kind of to filter down your hours or funnel down your hours as Brennan said. But if \u2013 I think if you\u2019ve been a salaried employee for years and you\u2019ve never been a consultant, there\u2019s a lot to learn and that first three to six months that I tend to recommend people don\u2019t try to jump in to it because it\u2019s going to take them several months just to figure all their stuff out. New experiences of taxes, new experience of finding projects, managing projects, billing clients, making sure they get paid, you know, there\u2019s all that stuff. And once you\u2019ve been doing it for six months to a year, all that becomes a natural but it is a learning curve upfront.\n[25:24] And I also think that if your added job that doesn\u2019t have you working a ton of hours, that it\u2019s actually more beneficial like if you\u2019re working 30, 40 hours a week at a salaried gig and they\u2019re not pushing you to 70 or 80 and you\u2019ve been there for several years and you already have the clout and you kind of the trust of people, it actually gives you a lot of time to kind of go and decompress and work on stuff on the side. You know, there is kind of dependence on how your day gig actually is and how they actually treat you and if you do have the autonomy outside of it and you do have the mental space outside of it to devote to your product because certainly if you are working 70-hour a weeks and have you doing on the weekends, then my answer would be to put \u2013 potentially I have to find a different salary job or to move in the consulting from there.\n[26:06] Brennan: The last time I had a salary job, I was working 80 hours a week and there\u2019s just no way I had any mental energy left to do anything else. So, I think if I had a very cushy safe and secure job, then you\u2019re right. I think not needing to jilt with business development or anything is useful in a lot of ways. So, I think Mike actually has a really good point.\n[26:24] Rob: So, obviously, you\u2019ve had several successes both with your \u2013 your SaaS app that you\u2019re building up. You\u2019ve had a successful consultancy you\u2019ve built, your E-book, your workshop, are there any major missteps that you feel like you\u2019ve made along the way that other people would be likely to make?\n[26:39] Brennan: I know one thing that I made a huge mistake of and that was letting my initial Planscope mailing list got cold. When I initially tried to cross sell the new book to that list because I haven\u2019t literally spoken to them in months, the reception was not nearly what it should have been. You know, conversely I did keep my list warm for the book. If you buy the book, you get on my newsletter and I send three advices once a week which people seem to really like. Within hours when I announced the workshop and kind of ramped up anticipation about the workshop, I literally almost sold out the workshop within a few hours because the list was warm. That\u2019s one huge mistake that I made with Planscope because I didn\u2019t really understand the value of relationships outside of a user entry and a database.\n[27:23] Rob: Yeah, the power of that list is not to be trifled with. Mike, do you have any missteps?\n[27:30] Mike: Yeah, I mean the one that I kind of harp on that I ran in to was getting in to a consultant arrangement where you getting paid as contingent upon somebody else getting paid. That was more of a contract issue than anything else. Sign something and not really thinking about it and you know, they\u2019re like, \u201cWe\u2019ll pay you within seven days when we get paid by our customer.\u201d And that was just sounded great. Their customer doesn\u2019t pay them, then I\u2019ve got no recourse to go to them because they didn\u2019t get paid. And you know, I sat around for it was probably close to six months before I got 30 some thousand dollars in\u2013 invoice is straightened out.\n[28:02] Rob: Okay, well cool. Let\u2019s talk about myths and all that \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of startup advice out there and as soon as you start actually working on a product, working on a startup and launching something, having people use it. Instantly, some of that startup advice becomes essentially a myth in your mind because it\u2019s just not true, right? It maybe had been true with that person who said it, it may have been true for that person, but there are some common things like eating your on dog food, you must be part of your target audience, you know, build something people want and all these things that may or may not turn out to be true if you launch and have a different experience. Anything come to mind that once weren\u2019t true but now is nothing more than \u2013 or maybe a startup myth?\n[28:40] Brennan: So, I pointed out three different things that I used to believe and no longer believe. The first is that I used to believe that you realistically couldn\u2019t consult or do something else and bootstrap a product. There\u2019s a huge emphasis on you need to take outside money so you can stay focus 100% on your product and that I just think that\u2019s simply not true. I think you can \u2014 you can multitask. You can work on both. So, I mean again it\u2019s a slow growth, tortoise and hare type of raise but in the long run, I think it\u2019s better, at least for me than the alternative. The second thing that I think I\u2019ve come to realize is you really don\u2019t need a business co-founder. I\u2019m a developer. I\u2019m also a designer but when it comes to things like Planscope, I run support. I do all the marketing. I did blogging. I pretty much handle everything. No one else works on it with me and it might seem overwhelming but I\u2019m very partial to low risk easy win B2B products that I\u2019m not inventing new markets. I don\u2019t need to have some crazy viral win to grow their product. What I found is that when you take that route, when you focus on solving things that businesses have, I think it is manageable by one person.\n[29:48] So, my third myth finally and this is something that took me a while to realize is the myth that marketing is boring. I\u2019ve actually come to prefer doing split testing over writing code. I just think it\u2019s a lot more interesting. I mean it\u2019s almost like people hacking. I mean you\u2019re getting to see like how different variations are affecting things or \u2013 I recently redid my on boarding completely and I was able to see tangible financial results pretty immediately afterwards. That\u2019s the stuff that really is interesting to me and I used to think that the marketing side of thing that\u2019s left for a marketing department, you know. All I care about is code quality and craftsmanship and everything else which are important but I\u2019m really enjoying the traction affecting things of the job.\n[30:30] Rob: For sure. What I\u2019m seeing with entrepreneurs who are \u2014 developers who are transitioning to entrepreneurs and I did the same thing is you start by disliking the marketing just because we consider the four-letter word in the development world because if you\u2019ve ever worked with marketers, they\u2019re always a pain in the ass because they\u2019re always making you do stuff as a developer that you don\u2019t want to do, you don\u2019t understand what they want you to do. And so, first you start kind of your standoffish to it and then as you start learning it and you start to enjoy and see the \u2013 like you said, its people hacking, it\u2019s engineering of business. There\u2019s like all these different ways to look at it but once you get in to it, it becomes super addictive and I found that that entrepreneurs who \u2013 the bootstrappers who are actually making it happen, they eventually making the switch that you\u2019ve said where you actually enjoy the marketing perhaps more than writing code. Writing code is still fun. Writing code is your first love but this new thing, shiny and new and it gives you the financial immediate feedback that you don\u2019t get to see when you\u2019re sitting or hacking away and creating a new business object or new database table. So, I could \u2013 I can totally see that. How about you, Mike?\n[31:30] Mike: Well, I think Brennan talked about two of the three. I would have ordered them slightly differently. The first one was that you need the co-founder and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at all.\n[31:37] Rob: Right, you\u2019ve long been in time \u2013 you\u2019ve long been \u2013\n[31:38] Mike: [Laughter] Yeah, I\u2019ve long been an anti co-founder and it\u2019s not \u2013\n[31:40] Rob: Yeah.\n[31:41] Mike: And it\u2019s not really so much anti co-founder is that not having the right co-founder is probably worse than having no co-founder and that\u2019s really what it is. I just think that people really need to understand that you if you get involved with the wrong co-founder is infinitely worse than doing everything yourself. The second one is that you need funding in order to do anything interesting. I think that there\u2019s a lot of people out there who are doing some very, very interesting things that they just don\u2019t have funding for what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re all bootstrapped or they got things to a certain point on their own and then they decided that they wanted to go after funding and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything inherently wrong with funding but I think that there is this frequency of notion out there that you need funding in order to be successful and I just don\u2019t think that that\u2019s true.\n[32:20] The third one is that if you read a lot of the \u2013 the successful people out there, it seems easy and you ready everything they say that they, you know, they\u2019ll talk about some marketing technique or something like that and you kind of intuitively understand it. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, well, yeah, that makes sense. I would have done that.\u201d But you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have done that and what you come to realize is that those things aren\u2019t necessarily hard but they\u2019re time-consuming to learn and the reason that they\u2019re time-consuming to learn is because you make a series of missteps before you kind of stumble on the right idea and then in retrospect everything should have been obvious to you but it wasn\u2019t.\n[32:57] So it\u2019s just that things that should take a lot less time especially when you\u2019re getting in to the marketing side of things, they\u2019re going to take substantially more time than you think they will because you\u2019re going to have to go through those series of missteps before you really understand what\u2019s going on and it\u2019s only in looking back out of it that you understand.\n[33:15] Rob: Right, I think, I, too was a victim of reading the blogs back from about 2000 to maybe 2005 and it was \u2013 it was folks like Paul Graham, Eric Sink, Joel Spolsky and they talked about their startup days and they just sounded so awesome. It sounded just like this romantic vision of this peaceful villa where you\u2019re just typing way some code and launching some products and I was totally a victim. So and I don\u2019t think \u2013 certainly don\u2019t think that was intentional on their part but it\u2019s just you\u2019re not going to write a blog post about the stuff that\u2019s really boring and as it turns out, a lot of the stuff that we do [Laughter] is pretty darn boring. Don\u2019t know if I would call a myth but definitely a misunderstanding of mine early on.\n[33:51] Some folks say that you have to be a user of your app like you have to be the number one user that you have to build something that you will use. And well, I do think that is super helpful, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a necessity and I absolutely think you can build something in other niches for other people, you know, still the low hanging B2B bootstrap ideas I\u2019m a big fan of. But I still think you can have a lot of success with that even if you\u2019re not necessarily in the niche that you\u2019re building for.\n[34:15] Brennan: I think it can be harmful to you to build something that you\u2019re a little too passionate about. One of the things that I\u2019ve tried to get pretty good at is putting my ear to the ground and listening to what people are saying and what problems they have day to day. And I think that is significantly better than the alternative which is you\u2019re in the shower in the morning and a great idea comes to you and you go and build it. I think doing that kind of I won\u2019t say market research but just listening to what people are venting it out, that\u2019s where Planscope came from. I was basically crawling through internet forums for freelancers and I started from there.\n[34:50] Rob: Very cool. So, the next question I have is do you have one or two traits that you think are the most important for a successful founder now that you\u2019re kind of knee deep in it?\n[34:59] Mike: I think one of the single most important traits of a successful founder is perseverance and understanding that you are going to make mistakes and that\u2019s perfectly okay, you know. Nobody escapes from the business world completely unscathed. That just doesn\u2019t happen. There are people who get really lucky but they still make mistakes along the way and it\u2019s learning from those mistakes and adjusting and listening to what your customers are telling you that really makes a difference at the end of the day. You\u2019re not going to hit homerun on the first day. That\u2019s generally doesn\u2019t happen. You can do a lot of things right but you\u2019re still going to make a few minor mistakes along the way and overtime, the number of mistakes that you make is going to go down in certain areas and then as you start to thread new ground, you\u2019re going to learn new things. You\u2019re going to make mistakes in those areas and then you\u2019ll essentially adjust in those other areas as well. So, I think that perseverance and in the phase of uncertainty is really the single key trait that somebody has to have.\n[35:56] Rob: I think the willingness to fail and to actually go out with the intention of failing at a few things is important trait that I learned early on. I was just thinking about six months ago when \u2013 I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s about ten months ago, now when I relaunched HitTail I had this marketing plan and I put that in to a task list for myself and I was going to try about there are like 18 different marketing approaches, all different kinds of tactics. And I look at it and said, \u201cYou know, if 18 of this fail, and only 2 succeed, I am going to have a growing startup.\u201d I\u2019m actually going to have an app that works and even if 19 of them fail but 1 of them is like a huge success, you can get 10, 20, 30% growth a month in an early stage bootstrap startup with just a single \u2013 single successful marketing tactic. And it was actually in my head early on that most of them would fail but I need to try all of them.\n[36:48] One, to get the updated experience with them and two, because I love learning, I love trying new things. And three, because I just didn\u2019t know which one was going to work best and which one is going to drive the most traffic. And so running through all these things, I now have learned a ton about all of them and I know how this, you know, much brighter vision for what I can do both with HitTail and with future products that I have. So, I think that the willingness to go out there and to take some risks and to bet both some money and some time. And it\u2019s not betting the farm on any of these single approaches but it\u2019s vesting some money and some time and learning from that and being able to take that knowledge and then invest, you know, as you move forward.\n[37:24] Brennan: Yes, I would point out cadence as being an important trait which goes along with what both of you were just talking about and what I mean by cadence is knowing that in order to be successful, it\u2019s going to be a lot of very small victories or a lot of very small steps. And I see a lot of founders who they go away in to a basement and write a product almost in secret. They have this idea of this grand launch day. They launch it and crickets and then they get discourage and fades away. I\u2019ve always been a big, big advocate of really a thousand launches, right? I never really saw my launch day as being anything really that significant except that now I had an avenue for getting paying customers in the door.\n[38:08] But there is nothing spectacular on my launch day and I think you read TechCrunch or these different publications and you hear about these grand launches and people adding millions of users overnight. Like I think I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s a long tail game. It\u2019s steady march. It\u2019s a cadence. It\u2019s \u2013 I do my, you know, continual amount of blogging and producing content that helps me with my organic visibility where I slowly build out new features base on what my customers are actually asking for instead of thinking it as all or nothing way of looking at things.\n[38:40] Rob: Right, as Dan Anders would say, \u201cIt\u2019s playing long ball.\u201d\n[38:43] Brennan:Right.\n[38:44] Rob: All right, so I\u2019m going to wrap this up with one final question and I\u2019m actually interested in hearing everyone\u2019s thoughts on this. We\u2019ll start with Brennan, where do you see your business or businesses one year from now? What do you envision?\n[38:57] Brennan: I will probably have another book out because there has been, again, I kind of mind my customer correspondents to figure out what problems people have and they try to see between the lines and what I could offer to them, you know, initially. In a year I would like to fully live off a combination of my products and I would also like to really optimize. I would like to have a very grand funnel that works across all of my products and makes the transition between each product very seamless because the way it\u2019s working now is all of my products really target a single audience. If I can pull that off, that will obviously help my growth of my sales which will, hopefully, get me even closer to cutting the cord on consulting.\n[39:41] Rob: Very nice. How about you, Mike, where do you see yourself with AuditShark, Altiris Training, forum software, what else you have going on?\n[39:50] Mike: [Laughter] Well \u2013\n[39:50] Rob: Where do you see that in a year?\n[39:51] Mike: Oh, on top of that, I will probably have published a book in about a year. So \u2013\n[39:55] Rob: There \u2013\n[39:55] Mike: There\u2019s a spoiler alert.\n[39:56] Brennan: [Laughter]\n[39:56] Rob: First announcement. Very cool!\n[39:57] Mike: Yup, yup.\n[39:58] Mike: I anticipate being completely wind off from a consulting probably within twelve months. I don\u2019t know how quickly that\u2019s going to go but I, you know, obviously have a lot of different things going on right now and it\u2019s a matter of kind of figuring out which ones are working, which ones aren\u2019t. I have probably three or four different things that are I\u2019m obviously juggling at the moment. Between all of them, I\u2019m just going to be figuring out what one works and which one doesn\u2019t and then, you know, putting some extra effort in to the things that are working, hopefully, leveraging some partnerships that I\u2019ve been working with people on and you know, like I said just getting on a consulting. That\u2019s kind of my main focus for, you know, the next six to eight months.\n[40:34] Rob: On my end, I anticipate or hope, however you like to say it, that HitTail will be a two at least 2X where it is today and with a potentially to be it about 3X it means growing at a pretty nice cliff right now. And I have a product manager in place that I\u2019ve mentioned a few times and he\u2019s taking on more and more responsibilities. So, over the next three to six months, I expected transition in to another product. More updates on that in the future.\n[41:03] Brennan: Nice.\n[41:04] Rob: Well, Brennan, thank you very much for coming on the program. We really appreciate your time in lending your insight. You know, someone who\u2019s knee deep in this process of transitioning from consulting to products, I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s a lot of folks in the audience who identify with where you\u2019re at inside this. I certainly appreciate it. If people want to get in touch with you, learn more about you, what\u2019s kind of the number one place they can go to get \u2013 maybe get in touch with you or just read more about your trials and tribulations?\n[41:28] Brennan: So, my \u2013 the Planscope blog has most of \u2013 I blog extensively and I do this because I\u2019ve realized that for me at least Hacker News can be a pretty good source of new business and I\u2019ve put up quite a few different blog post about \u2013 well, I\u2019m very open and transparent with my numbers. Well \u2013 I\u2019ll detail on boarding experiments and the results of that or one of the more recent ones was about how I built up this runaway of cash through these different products. planscope.io/blog is where you\u2019ll find a lot of my writing. You can e-mail me at me@brennandunn.com or I\u2019m on Twitter @BrennanDunn, B-R-E-N-N-A-N D-U-N-N.\n[42:08] Rob: Well, very good.

The book I\u2019m considering writing is in fact, security related and will be used to help do marketing for AuditShark. I consider it to be a long term play, just like AuditShark.\nAlso, you may not agree with me on this, but I feel really good about where AuditShark is at today. That\u2019s not something that I could have said 2 months ago when I felt like I hit a brick wall and my morale dropped like a stone. But I ground it out, did what needed to be done, and things are looking good again.\nThis month, I\u2019m on the verge of launching a viable product. To quit now would be nothing short of foolish. At the very least, I need to see where the cards fall but from what I\u2019ve been told, customers really want & need this type of product. You may not need it, but a lot of people do. ]]>\nBy: Sandy\nhttp://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-106-moving-from-consulting-to-products-with-brennan-dunn/comment-page-1#comment-2345\nSandy\nWed, 21 Nov 2012 22:19:54 +0000\nhttp://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/?p=1056#comment-2345\nI only infrequently listen to the TechZing podcast, but I understand what you mean. Also, I didn\u2019t know Mike had set a public deadline. This is good. I guess we\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens! In any case, there are good lessons to be learned either way. ]]>\nBy: Paul Silver\nhttp://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-106-moving-from-consulting-to-products-with-brennan-dunn/comment-page-1#comment-2343\nPaul Silver\nWed, 21 Nov 2012 16:13:59 +0000\nhttp://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/?p=1056#comment-2343\nHey Sandy,\nI\u2019d see what you mean if we were about 3-4 months ago, when it did seem Audit Shark was flatlining. However, since then Mike has re-focussed (I guess \u2018pivoted\u2019 is the current slang) on to a different market having had problems communicating with banks, has set himself a deadline for getting the beta test running and how has it out there to a very limited audience.\nThis is why I think he has buckled down and is back to getting somewhere with the project. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s fast, but I think there is some useful progress.\nI\u2019d compare this favourably with, say, the AnyFu project run by Justin and Jason who produce the TechZing podcast. It seems like a great product that they are constantly not finishing for one reason or another, mainly distracting themselves with new projects \u2013 building a mobile product for one of them, teaching his son and other children to code for the other.\nAlthough I enjoy listening to TechZing, J&J\u2019s self-distracting behaviour regularly makes me want to bang my head against the wall, whereas I feel Mike and Rob tend to push each other forwards a little more. Hence why I find Mike\u2019s progress, however slow, something I admire, rather causing more dent making. ]]>\nBy: Sandy\nhttp://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-106-moving-from-consulting-to-products-with-brennan-dunn/comment-page-1#comment-2340\nSandy\nWed, 21 Nov 2012 13:37:12 +0000\nhttp://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/?p=1056#comment-2340\nHey Paul, great comments.\nAgain, it\u2019s nothing personal towards Mike. I am employed full time and am married, so I know how hard it is to work on your own projects during nights/weekends, and have plenty of failed ideas.\nI think the issue is, if you look (or listen) back on old podcasts, it\u2019s ALWAYS the same ol\u2019thing with Audit Shark. This bug, or that bug, this issue with his contractor, that new feature, etc. but no real progress. Sure there are beta testers, but how many, and does this really represent a market?\nWhat happened to creating a MVP? What happened to failing early? What happened to solving a problem people are dying to get solved? (great read btw: http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html )\nThe podcast\u2019s slogan is \u201ca podcast that helps developers, designers and entrepreneurs be awesome at launching software products\u201d, however in Audit Shark all I see the exact opposite of startup common wisdom.\nThis provides me nothing as a podcast listener. ]]>\nBy: Paul Silver\nhttp://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-106-moving-from-consulting-to-products-with-brennan-dunn/comment-page-1#comment-2339\nPaul Silver\nWed, 21 Nov 2012 11:19:04 +0000\nhttp://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/?p=1056#comment-2339\nI\u2019m not understanding your problem, Sandy. Mike has Audit Shark with beta testers and is trying to finish code and deal with contracting other programmers. When balanced with doing work for clients to pay the bills, progress can be very slow. You could say he should have targeted the web industry rather than banks originally, but hindsight is 20/20. It sounds like AS is far from a dead project to me, and that it\u2019s getting very close to launching. It\u2019s taken time and I\u2019m sure Mike wishes progress would have been quicker, but there\u2019s little he can do about that now apart from push forwards.\nPersonally, I like knowing that sometimes building a product on the side of consulting/freelancing takes time and that progress can be a struggle. I\u2019m struggling to find time to work on my own product too, and knowing Mike is grinding along is an inspiration to me. Giving up on a project which is so close to launch would be a waste of all of his effort and investment.\nSome thoughts on the (potential) book:\nHe hasn\u2019t said what it\u2019s about, it could be about securing servers, and act as marketing material for Audit Shark. Alternatively it could be about launching a software product as a consultant, so would be more about compiling up information in the podcast episodes and adding more. Neither of these sounds like a bad idea.\nOn the other hand, it could be something completely unrelated and is what Mike\u2019s using to relax away from code and projects. That could be a good thing as it may help him prevent burn out. However, I think this is the least likely option as I don\u2019t think he\u2019d have mentioned it in this episode.\nIf you were to criticise anything as a distraction from AS, surely it would be Altiris Training? I was unsure about that, but view it as a kind of side project to make a little money and complete quickly, so Mike could see he could make progress and launch something. That can be very helpful if you\u2019re stuck in a project that\u2019s taking much longer to build than you expected, and can give you some confidence and momentum back in everything you\u2019re doing. ]]>\nBy: Jian\nhttp://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-106-moving-from-consulting-to-products-with-brennan-dunn/comment-page-1#comment-2336\nJian\nTue, 20 Nov 2012 19:18:07 +0000\nhttp://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/?p=1056#comment-2336\nYes, second Sandy above. My feeling doing projects is, if a project lost the momentum, it is hard to just drag it alone. It is better to move on and build up momentum on new product/services. ]]>\nBy: Sandy\nhttp://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-106-moving-from-consulting-to-products-with-brennan-dunn/comment-page-1#comment-2335\nSandy\nTue, 20 Nov 2012 18:46:36 +0000\nhttp://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/?p=1056#comment-2335\nMike\u2026 you\u2019re writing a book? And STILL haven\u2019t finished Audit Shark?!\nIt\u2019s painful! How much has it been already? Like 3 years?\nWe all have projects that we never finish; that\u2019s perfectly fine. But just be honest with yourself, and with the listeners, and close Audit Shark.\nIn my experience, officially giving up on a project (instead of just kind of pushing it to the side) is a lot better idea. You no longer have that little voice in your head nagging you about not finishing it. It\u2019s done, you\u2019ve learned your lesson, and you can freely move forward.\nSo please, spare us another episode of you saying what bug you\u2019re working on, who you\u2019re going to hire to do what, that database issue you\u2019re after, etc. That\u2019s not what your target audience is interested in.\nRob, your comments?\n(Sorry I\u2019m so direct) ]]>",
