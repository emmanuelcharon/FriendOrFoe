The Attorney General of Florida, Bill McCollum, yesterday requested, in a letter, that other state Attorney Generals join him in \u201ca full review of the individual mandate.\u201d McCollum writes \u201cserious doubts have been voiced whether the individual mandate is grounded in one of Congress\u2019 enumerated powers. For example, if the individual mandate is treated as a fine on a person for conducting no activity at all, it may not fall within the scope of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Commerce Clause. If the individual mandate is treated as a tax, the nature of that tax may limit how the revenue provision is viewed under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Taxing Power.\u201d\nThis is an indication that many States are concerned that the Federal Government is overreaching and violating the constitutional rights of citizens.  The New York Times reports, \u201cMr. McCollum\u2019s stance places him in line with the attorneys general of South Carolina and nearly a dozen other states who have also threatened to sue over the mandate.\u201d The bill is yet to be signed into law and many Members of Congress are threatening to introduce legislation to repeal Obamacare and lawyers are lining up to challenge the constitutionality of the legislation.\nThe issue of whether the individual mandate is constitutional is a new front against Obamacare. The NYT reports \u201cThe Heritage Foundation, for example, posted a lengthy legal analysis on Dec. 9 that argued that Congress had specific, limited powers that did not include \u2018the distinct constitutional power to compel persons to purchase a contract of insurance from a private insurance company.\u2019 That report said that the federal health insurance requirement differed from mandates requiring that drivers be insured because auto insurance is connected to the choice to drive.\u201d\nAlthough ObamaCare seems to be close to the goal line, many are saying the health care fight is not over yet. Either the House or the Senate, or both, need to make significant compromises before this bill can get to the President\u2019s desk. With all the threatened lawsuits over the individual mandate, maybe this will become a hot issue during negotiations over the final version of the health care reform bill.\nAlso see:\nSenator Orrin Hatch\u2019s (R-UT) speech at The Heritage Foundation.\nHans Von Spakovsky\u2019s analysis at NRO Online.\nBrian Darling at Big Government.", "author": "Brian Darling", "semantria_id": "b3339d85cb1a11e2a2c3406c8f137d85", "semantria": {"status": "PROCESSED", "sentiment_polarity": "negative", "config_id": "b12a1cc1-77fc-4466-8f62-94c366dc9fca", "language": "English", "phrases": [{"sentiment_polarity": "negative", "title": "serious doubts", "negating_phrase": "", "sentiment_score": -0.7, "is_negated": false, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "negative", "title": "threatened", "negating_phrase": "", "sentiment_score": -0.636, "is_negated": false, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "negative", "title": "violating", "negating_phrase": "", "sentiment_score": -0.6, "is_negated": false, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "negative", "title": "threatening", "negating_phrase": "", "sentiment_score": -0.6, "is_negated": false, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "negative", "title": "repeal", "negating_phrase": "", "sentiment_score": -0.5, "is_negated": false, "type": "detected"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "individual mandate"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "individual mandate"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "been voiced"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "individual mandate"}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "type": "possible", "title": "enumerated powers"}], "topics": [{"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "title": "Health", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "hitcount": 0, "type": "concept", "strength_score": 0.72179765}, {"sentiment_polarity": "neutral", "title": "Law", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "hitcount": 0, "type": "concept", "strength_score": 0.6295574}, {"sentiment_polarity": "positive", "title": "Health", "sentiment_score": 1.215553, "hitcount": 4, "type": "query", "strength_score": 0.0}], "summary": "The chorus of concern that an individual mandate forcing Americans to purchase health insurance is at a crescendo...

Second, it would require people to purchase a specific service that would be heavily regulated by the federal government.[1]   The very minute after obama signs any bill into law, the lawsuits will start.\n 12-30-2009, 06:20 PM\nLocation: On Top\n 12,281 posts, read 5,679,243 times\nReputation: 3876\n 12-30-2009, 06:26 PM\nLocation: On Top\n 12,281 posts, read 5,679,243 times\nReputation: 3876\nHeritage Foundation = Neo-conservative, Rabid-right, propaganda machine....no wonder sanrene reads there!\n 12-30-2009, 06:28 PM\nLocation: Chicagoland\n 41,226 posts, read 19,665,468 times\nReputation: 6943\nCome on, be brave and check out the article..maybe you'll learn something, open your mind and have something intelligent to say about the issue.\n 12-30-2009, 06:28 PM\nLocation: Foot of the Rockies\n 58,305 posts, read 43,009,596 times\nReputation: 14764\nQuote:\n Originally Posted by sanrene\nFrom states Attorney Generals, members of Congress, lawyers in general.\n Law Suits Threatened Over Obamacare \u00bb The Foundry\n Unsigned = POS\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/he...ccollum&st=cse\n Looks like political grandstanding to me:\nQuote:\n  The attorney general, William McCollum, a Republican who is running for governor in 2010\n Can the Congress actually force people to buy a product as a condition of their citizenship?
